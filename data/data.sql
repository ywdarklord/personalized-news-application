An early strike by Yacine Brahimi gave the hosts the lead and several brilliant saves by goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, making only his second league appearance for the club, kept Lionel Messi and Co at bay. Tata Martino’s side looked impotent, unable to breach an organised and disciplined defence, leaving them a point behind La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid, who play on Sunday.  Beaten: Barcelona slumped to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Granada on Saturday night     Opener: Granada\'s Algerian midfielder Yacine Brahimi (left) celebrates putting Granada in the lead  Match factsGranada: Karnezis, Nyom, Ilori, Murillo (Mainz 91\'), Foulquier, Iturra, Fran Rico, Recio, Brahimi (Bravo 65\'), Piti, El-Arabi.Goal: Brahimi 16Subs not used: Ighalo, Fernandez Alvalleros, Coeff, Fatau, Success AjayiBooked:Barcelona: Pinto, Montoya, Mascherano, Busquets (Sanchez 78\'), Adriano (Alba 67\'), Song, Cesc, Iniesta, Pedro, Messi, Neymar.Subs not used: Xavi, Tello, Dani Alves, Sergi, Olazabal ParedesBooked: Neymar, Messi, BusquetsAtt: 23,500 Messi in particular looked dreadful, completely ineffective, just as he was against Atletico during the defeat in midweek. The Barcelona coach made several changes ahead of Wednesday\'s Copa del Rey final against arch-rivals Real Madrid. It was a risky strategy because playing at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes is rarely easy. Real Madrid lost at this stadium last season and Barcelona barely scraped a win. Marc Bartra was injured so Sergio Busquets stepped into central defence and Alex Song took his place in midfield. Jordi Alba and Dani Alves were rested ahead of the upcoming Clasico, with Martin Montoya and Adriano brought in on the right and left of the defence respectively. Those two combined early on, when Adriano delivered a floating cross from the left to where Montoya had charged into the box, but the Spaniard headed straight at Karnezis. Then came a hammer blow for Martino and his men, when Granada captain Fran Rico fed a through-ball into Brahimi\'s path after 15 minutes. The forward held off Montoya inside the box, steadied himself and drove the ball past Jose Manuel Pinto at his near post. Los Carmenes exploded in delight, in stark contrast to the bewildered looking Barcelona bench, with Xavi looking particularly shaken.  Winner: Brahimi scored the only goal of the game which was enough to defeat Barca Pace: Pedro (left) gets past Granada midfielder Fran Rico in the first half at the Estadio Nuevo Los Carmenes Granada believed they should have had a penalty soon after when Youssef El Arabi was caught by Javier Mascherano, but referee Carlos Delgado Ferreiro waved away the appeals. It would have been a soft decision but the Argentine caught his man and did not touch the ball. Messi, looking particularly listless, nodded wide from Neymar\'s inswinging cross.Fabregas, who has been poor since the turn of the year, had a good chance to equalise after 28 minutes but his shot from 12 yards was blocked. A Neymar strike suffered the same fate, as Martino\'s side pressed for the equaliser. The Brazilian then launched a 30-yard effort at goal but Karnezis palmed it away spectacularly.

Neymar was then winded by a forearm from Manuel Iturra, when the defender stood his ground as the Brazilian ran towards him.The forward was clearly furious and threw his water bottle to the floor after the officials took their time to allow him back on.Neymar, looking like the only Blaugrana player who was interested in trying to salvage their title bid, dribbled past two men on the left and fed Iniesta, whose strike deflected wide off of one of his team-mates. It summed up Barcelona\'s first half.Barcelona’s forward was also booked for a frustrated hack at Nyom before the half drew to a close.Fabregas tested the waters early in the second half with a snapped half-volley from the edge of the box but Karnezis was equal to it, diving low to fist it away. Neymar then had a low shot which whistled past the far post with the goalkeeper beaten. Messi forced the Greek goalkeeper into an excellent fingertip save from a free-kick, and he denied Busquets after a goal-mouth scramble from the subsequent corner.Brahimi had a brilliant chance to double the lead when played in on goal, but this time Montoya was able to deny him with a last-ditch challenge. Impossible task: Allan Nyom (left) tries to tackle Barcelona\'s maestro Andres Iniesta   Danger: Neymar was a threat despite picking up a knock midway through the second half  Barcelona looked lout of ideas, just as they had against Diego Simeone’s team on Wednesday night. Martino threw on Alba and Alexis Sanchez for Adriano and Busquets as his team frantically searched for the equaliser. Granada went close again when Piti\'s low strike was saved by Pinto, who spilled the ball, but El Arabi was offside when he tried to reach the rebound. Pedro fired a ball across the face of goal but Messi stretched and failed to reach it as we entered the final 10 minutes of a gripping encounter. Neymar nearly made the difference when he flicked it past Karnezis, but Illori was alert and nipped it in the bud by mopping up behind the goalkeeper. Onslaught: Barcelona couldn\'t manage a goal despite having over 24 shots at the Granada goal  Granada actually created the best chance of the second half at the death, hitting Barcelona on the break. El Arabi was sent clean through on goal but Pinto denied him, and blocked the rebound as well. As the full-time whistle blew Granada’s players celebrated wildly, having gained essential ground in the relegation dogfight. But the implications were just as serious for Barcelona, because now the title is out of their hands and they need Atletico to stumble before they visit the Nou Camp on the last day. Given how well the Rojiblanco have been performing, that does not look likely.   More...

Santi Cazorla looked calm as he strode the 50 yards to the penalty spot. He seemed assured as he placed his spot-kick. And then he delivered, driving his effort past Scott Carson. Only then, as the ball nestled in the net, did Arsenal finally look to be in control of this tie at Wembley Stadium. They will participate in the FA Cup final here next month after all. Arsene Wenger will challenge for a trophy and, after nine years, that wait for silverware might be ended. And yet, after what was at times an aimless and undisciplined performance in front of owner Stan Kroenke, it will be hard to interpret this season as a major step forward. Eventually, playing 4-4-2 and launching long balls, they rescued the game. But it was hardly a glorious triumph in the spirit of Wenger’s past.  Sliding in: Per Mertesacker dramatically equalised for Arsenal late on in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday  Cool as you like!

There was no way back from there for Wigan, not after Mikel Arteta, Kim Kallstrom and Olivier Giroud scored so comfortably. Not even the belated efforts of Jean Beausejour and James McArthur could make up the lost ground. Yet for almost 20 minutes of this game Wenger had been staring into a football abyss. Arsenal have endured their share of humiliations this season and this grand, old manager has been exposed many times. But losing to a Championship side in the competition that everyone concludes they are destined to win, having been tactically out-thought, would surely have proved the nadir not just of this season but arguably of Wenger’s  17-year reign. ‘It was important mentally we didn’t go out tonight,’ said Wenger at the end. ‘If you imagine the consequences of going out, it is quite worrying.’ Quite. For much of the match, that was Arsenal’s major preoccupation. ‘I couldn’t be prouder of my team today,’ said Wigan manager Uwe  Rosler. To fail at penalties was hardly Germanic but Rosler allowed himself a wry smile. ‘I was asked if we practised and I said, “No. I’m German. We don’t need to”. But we want to be back here in May for the play-offs — and then, I promise you, we will practise.’  Stroked home: Mikel Arteta comfortably placed past Scott Carson as Arsenal won on penalties   Wild celebrations: Wigan were ahead for just under 19 minutes in the second half of the semi-final   Boost: The big German celebrates in front of the Arsenal fans as he nudged in an equaliser Down he goes! Callum McManaman was hacked down by Per Mertesacker in the second half   Correct call: Referee Michael Oliver thought long and hard before pointing to the penalty spot   Big game player: McManaman had been a thorn in Arsenal\'s side all afternoon   Stroked home: Gomez calmly placed his penalty home to put the underdogs in front  Still, Wigan are more used to days out at Wembley than Arsenal, so their adeptness for the task was no surprise. Having endured a shaky start — Yaya Sanogo headed against Carson in the opening minutes, Alex Oxlade- Chamberlain sprinted clear before being denied by Carson and Bacary Sagna blazed wide from a tight angle — Wigan began to establish themselves.McArthur and Jordi Gomez found their range in midfield but it was Callum McManaman, a runner made for the wide open spaces of Wembley, who was a constant threat. At times, his contest with Thomas Vermaelen and Nacho Monreal was a mis-match, and not in favour of the established internationals.Wigan grew in confidence, controlling possession when they could and springing on the counter when they could not. Never did Arsenal look secure — the wide gaps between defensive and midfield lines were again ready to be exploited, as they have been by the best Premier League sides this season. Taking a breather: Wenger dishes out a team talk to his players ahead of a tense 30 minutes of extra time Clash of heads: Emmerson Boyce and Yaya Sanogo bang into each other when contesting a high ball   Back: Aaron Ramsey made his first start for Arsenal since suffering an injury against West Ham in December   Rising highest: Captain Boyce lets Sanogo know he\'s there as the pair battle for possession   McManaman set off on a dangerous run across the penalty area after 59 minutes and tempted Per Mertesacker into an injudicious tackle. Down McManaman tumbled and the penalty was awarded.For four minutes, Jordi Gomez was forced to wait to take the spot-kick as Monreal was treated then substituted. But, when his moment came, Gomez struck his penalty well into the right-hand corner of the net. Tussle: Jean Beausejour tries to shrug Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain off the ball in the opening stages   Showing respect: Scarves in memory of the victims of Hillsborough were placed on 96 seats at Wembley     Inch perfect! Thomas Vermaelen slides in on Wigan striker Marc-Antoine Fortune to win the ball   Did he do enough? Santi Cazorla didn\'t affect the game in Wigan\'s final third - click here for our brilliant matchzone. Big chance! Yaya Sanogo forced Scott Carson into a brilliant early save on Saturday evening   Blood and thunder: Nacho Monreal unfairly stops Wigan winger Callum McManaman in his tracks   Driving on: Oxlade-Chamberlain surpasses Stephen Crainey and Beausejour in midfield McManaman would soon be substituted with cramp, and Arsenal seemed relieved. More significant were the boos that rang out Wenger took off the popular Lukas Podolski and played two up front, with Giroud coming on. It felt like an open revolt against the man in whom fans once placed all their trust.Arsenal’s 60,000 supporters were mutinous. It was not that chances didn’t come but Sanogo was struggling dreadfully up front, too raw for a game of this magnitude. Giroud was deemed too tired to start and Arsenal have not strengthened. They pushed on desperately in the last minutes of normal time but, when Carson pulled of a magnificent save from Kieran Gibbs on 82 minutes, you feared for Arsenal.But, when a corner fell for Oxlade-Chamberlain on 82 minutes, he drove a shot into the ground, it bounced up into the area, Mertesacker stooped at the far post to guide it home and Wembley erupted.Was it celebration or relief? It wasn’t the kind of goal we associate with Wenger — but these days Arsenal will take what they can get.In extra-time, Aaron Ramsey and Sanogo set up Oxlade-Chamberlain, who drove against the bar. But at least Arsenal can say they survived. Just dink it! The 20-year-old just couldn\'t quite lift an effort beyond Carson as Arsenal pressed for an opener   Touching moment: Wigan boss Uwe Rosler passes on instructions to James Perch on the touchline   Where\'s that going? The busy Oxlade-Chamberlain enjoys another tussle with Crainey  What\'s up, Arsene? The Arsenal manager looks concerned as Lukas Podolski receives treatment   Out of the shadows: Lukasz Fabianski was given the nod to keep goal for Arsenal in the semi-final clash   Tough time: Sanogo missed two big chances in the first half as Arsenal struggled to exert control   Finding your man: Santi Cazorla beats James McArthur in midfield with a splitting pass  Watching brief: Jordi Gomez can only stand and stare as Cazorla brings down a high ball   Nervous times!

It has taken a couple of months, but the change in philosophy that Felix Magath demanded when he was brought in to rescue Fulham appears to be paying off. The German was exhausted at the end of this encounter. ‘I’m kapput,’ he declared. ‘That was a very dramatic 90 minutes.’ But it was also the product of the cultural shift that he has overseen since arriving at Craven Cottage; a shift that sees the players eat breakfast and lunch together; that means those who are injured do not just come in for treatment in the morning but have their days divided into three sessions with the medical staff. Magath sets an example by continuing to cycle to the club’s Motspur Park training ground every day. No longer on Boris bikes but on three bicycles that were recently purchased by the club. In his mind it is a further representation of his back-to-basics approach. Magath: I am very kaput. It was a traumatic 90 minutes.

Fighting for their own survival under the guidance of a new manager desperate to make a good first impression, Norwich made it far from easy for Fulham. In spells, they were much the better side. Magath acknowledged as much afterwards, admitting his side were a little ‘lucky’. But there was a collective will about Fulham, a defiance and a determination that proved the difference between these teams and might just be decisive in determining which one remains in the top flight and which goes down. It was the sheer courage with which Fulham defended that was so memorable, Rodallega’s clearance to deny Michael Turner in the 74th minute a perfect example of Fulham’s work ethic, plus some wonderful saves from David Stockdale. What a transformation the Colombian Rodallega has undergone. Not so long ago he broke down in tears in the dugout, shattered by defeat to Sheffield United in the FA Cup. And what a transformation, too, for Mahamadou Diarra, the former Real Madrid midfielder somehow returning from a career-threatening injury to deliver two huge performances in the last two games.  Breakthrough: Fulham\'s Rodallega scores past Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy Scramble: Norwich John Ruddy loses the ball from a corner Hurry up: Norwich caretaker manager Neil Adams runs across the pitch towards the dugouts   You were warned: A fan treats his bleeding nose after being hit in the face with a ball while standing behind the warm up net  Double time: Fulham\'s Mahamadou Diarra (right) and Steve Sidwell battle for the ball with Norwich City\'s Ricky van Wolfswinkel (left)  ‘More people will believe we can stay in the league now,’ said Magath, and so they should. ‘It helps us to be confident.’ He would have had sympathy for Neil Adams, promoted from the Under 18s side to suddenly take charge at Norwich after the dismissal of Chris Hughton. ‘I couldn’t have asked for any more,’ said Adams. ‘We had some great chances and I thought we were the better side for long periods. But there are some very sad players in that dressing room.’ They are sad because Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal now stand between them and survival and, as Adams acknowledged, they are ‘four of the best teams in Europe, never mind England’.  Tangle: Fulham\'s Mahamadou Diarra (left) goes downin challenge from Norwich City\'s Leroy Fer  Quick feet: Norwich City\'s Leroy Fer (left) takes on Fulham\'s Steve Sidwell  Close up: Norwich midfielder Bradley Johnson has a shot at goal  Focused: Norwich caretaker manager Neil Adams keeps an eye on the action  On the ball: Leroy Fer of Norwich takes on the Fulham defence But perhaps there is a lesson here for Norwich. Perhaps they should have acted long before now. Perhaps they should have had the conviction Fulham displayed when they changed their manager for a second time this season and recruited Magath. Former BBC Radio 1 DJ David Hamilton did his usual just before kick-off in his role as stadium announcer, declaring that it was ‘show time’ here at Craven Cottage. But, for once, it far from captured the magnitude of this match — not to mention the sense of anxiety. In fairness to the Fulham players, they appeared less nervous than their supporters and Magath’s decision to start with Rodallega immediately looked like a prudent move. He wasted no time in imposing himself on the Norwich defence, threatening with a shot across the face of John Ruddy’s goal after bursting clear.  Jump for joy: Fulham\'s Brede Hangeland, left, and keeper David Stockdale celebrate after the final whistle   Despair: Robert Snodgrass can\'t hide his disappointment after defeat at Fulham   Floored: Nathan Redmond sits on the pitch  Positive: Sebastien Bassong gives thumbs up to fans and tries to console Nathan Redmond   Dropped in it: Norwich fans fear the worst with four tough fixtures to come Stockdale, nevertheless, had to be at his very best. It was a terrific save that denied Ricky Van Wolfswinkel and a similarly impressive stop to then deny Leroy Fer from the resulting corner. Stockdale was a little more fortuitous moments later. He appeared to be beaten by a Robert Snodgrass free-kick but was saved by the crossbar. The sense of frustration for an animated Adams was compounded when Rodallega then struck five minutes before the break, producing a brilliant left-foot volley after Steve Sidwell had flicked on Lewis Holtby’s free-kick. Over in the technical area, Magath punched the air, even if he would have remained concerned by the opportunities Norwich were creating. No sooner had the second half began than Van Wolfswinkel was through with only Stockdale to beat. Fortunately for Fulham, though, the Dutchman continues to fail in justifying his inflated price tag and after little more than an hour he was hooked.  Take off: Fulham defender John Heitinga dives in   No way: Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass is tackled by Fernando Amorebieta (left) and Brede Hangeland   Delight: Goalscorer Hugo Rodallega celebrates victory with Lewis Holtby and Pajtim Kasami While Rodallega might have scored a second had it not been for a clearance from Martin Olsson, Norwich continued to press. It seemed certain Snodgrass would score after Olsson had accelerated on to a ball from Bradley Johnson and squared it for a colleague. But a courageous Brede Hangeland launched himself across the six-yard box and Snodgrass sent his effort wide. Fulham lived on their wits, with Fernando Amorebieta producing a marvellous block to send Gary Hooper’s shot for a corner, with Rodallega then diverting that Turner header to safety. Near the end, Ashkan Dejagah should have scored a second for Fulham, only to blast his effort over with only Ruddy to beat. Had it mattered, he might have been ‘kapput’, too.    More...

He appeared to be beaten by a Robert Snodgrass free-kick but was saved by the crossbar.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The sense of frustration for an animated Adams was compounded when Rodallega then struck five minutes before the break, producing a brilliant left-foot volley after Steve Sidwell had flicked on Lewis Holtby’s free-kick.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Over in the technical area, Magath punched the air, even if he would have remained concerned by the opportunities Norwich were creating.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">No sooner had the second half began than Van Wolfswinkel was through with only Stockdale to beat.

Unfortunately, as players warmed up before the Barclay\'s Premier League game between Fulham and Norwich City, the hapless supporter was hit square in the face by one of those errant missiles he had been warned of - leaving him with a brutally bloodied nose. Despite being in obvious pain, the unknown fan appeared to see the funny side of the accident after having the signage pointed out to him.

It’s not so much goals that have been the problem for Gus Poyet’s side as scoring them at the right end, and their jinx struck again at the worst possible time at The Stadium of Light on Saturday. They were in the ascendancy and looking the likelier winners when Everton’s livewire on-loan winger Gerard Deulofeu went through his repertoire of tricks on the right to leave Marcos Alonso flat-footed and clipped the ball back from the bye-line. An involuntary movement of Wes Brown’s left leg failed to block the danger and, instead, deflected the ball past Vito Mannone for a 75th-minute addition to a collection of own goals that is approaching record proportions.  Winner: Everton celebrate Wes Brown\'s own goal in the second half at the Stadium of Light   Low point: Brown looks into the net after scoring an own goal for Sunderland   Vital: Deulofeu celebrates his cross caused Brown to turn into his own net   Down?

Another two, and they will have the dubious distinction of equalling Leicester’s record, set in 2003-04, when Frank Sinclair was in his prime. It was no laughing matter for Poyet, of course, after his spirited side finished empty-handed and found themselves seven points adrift of fourth-bottom Norwich, with a run-in that includes games against both Manchester teams and Chelsea. The Sunderland manager was rendered almost speechless by his team’s wretched luck, as he said: ‘We competed against one of the form teams in the division and matched them for passing and attempts on goal, and then that happens. ‘I don’t have a word for how I feel, because it’s not just one emotion. It just seems that whatever we do, something goes wrong. It could be a decision, a deflected shot or an own goal. Whatever it is, it goes against us, and it is hard to take. I just can’t explain it, the way own goals keep going in. ‘Can we stay up? There is always a chance, but we are running out of games. Things need to change, and they need to change quickly.’ The win lifted Everton above Arsenal into fourth, and Roberto Martinez backed them to stay there, as he reflected on a 66-point tally that is their best-ever in the Premier League.  Touch: Ross Barkley (centre) looks to bring the ball down in the Sunderland penalty area Calm down: Referee Lee Probert speaks to John O\'Shea during Everton\'s win against Sunderland Chance: Naismith had several opportunities to put Everton ahead but couldn\'t find his shooting boots Leon Osman (centre) appeals for a foul as his team attempt to break the deadlock against Sunderland  Gerard Deulofeu put in some hard graft for his team and played a crucial part in Everton\'s opening goal - Click here to find out more from our brilliant Match Zone service  Down the wing: Deulofeu was a constant threat alongside Everton\'s right wing   Get out of the way: Deulofeu is closed down by Marcos Alonso and Lee Cattermole   Solid: Connor Wickham (left) is tackled Sylvain Distin during the match at the Stadium of Light ‘At the start of the season, there were six clubs with big budgets who were supposed to be competing for Champions’ League places,’ said the Everton manager. ‘We were not one of them, so there is no pressure on us. We will keep fighting for the prize we want, and we will do it without the pressure others are feeling.‘I thought the game was tense and cagey, and there wasn’t a lot of quality, but that was because there was so much at stake for both sides. It was a bit of quality that won it for us, though. Gerard is a boy who keeps going forward and attacking defenders, and he got his reward. It needed a bit of magic to stop it being a scrappy 0-0, and that’s what he came up with.’There was plenty of endeavour from both sides, but both were let down by wayward finishing.Steven Naismith set the tone in only the ninth minute after smartly wrong-footing the close-marking Wes Brown but spoiling all his good work by blazing over from near the penalty spot. Touchline: The two managers try desperately to get messages across to their players  Get off: Sunderland\'s Ki Sung Yueng (left) has words after a strong tackle by Everton\'s James McCarthy   Close: Naismith reacts after the Scot misses a chance in the first halfKi Sung-Yueng was next to miss out with the goal at his mercy, though he could at least point to an athletic goalline clearance by John Stones for his misfortune.The Sunderland midfielder looked to have done everything right, after latching on to a weak Leighton Baines back pass and rounding keeper Tim Howard. He even struck his angled shot accurately enough, but Stones appeared from nowhere to fling himself in the way on the line.Sunderland stepped it up at the start of the second half and went close through John O’Shea, Alonso and Ki Sung-Yueng as one scramble followed another in the Everton area.Increasingly hopeful home fans even replicated the famous old Roker Roar as they sensed the growing probability of a Sunderland player on the scoresheet. When it duly transpired, though, it was met with near-silence, as Brown joined Phil Bardsley (2), Steven Fletcher, Carlos Cuellar and O’Shea with an own goal next to his name.           Instruction: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet barks orders at his team during the Premier League clash   In the air: Lee Cattermole (top) beats Naismith to a header in the first half  Possession: Connor Wickham (centre) keeps the ball away from a watchful John Stones (right)   Defend: Wes Brown (right) does enough to block a Lukaku shot in the first half   Tussle: Deulofeu (top) and Marcos Alonso battle for the ball during the Premier League match   Respect: Sunderland and Everton players observe the minutes silence in memory of the Hillsborough disaster     More...

opener for the Baggies after just 27 seconds It was the unlikeliest scene of deja vu: West Bromwich Albion’s players on the floor after giving away a lead that had seemed unassailable to draw 3-3 in the final seconds at The Hawthorns. This time it was Tottenham making off with a late, late point when none looked possible, just a fortnight after Cardiff had done the same in an astonishing finish that appeared unique. But Tim Sherwood oversaw a repeat. His team fought back from 3-0 down to get level in the fourth minute of added time thanks to Christian Eriksen’s splendid goal that owed a lot to a cool head in frantic circumstances. Albion had been 2-0 up inside four minutes through Matej Vydra and Chris Brunt, extended their lead before half-time with a strike from Stephane Sessegnon, and were on course for a priceless win in their survival scrap.

You do get edgy. If you keep taking punches you’re going to get knocked out.’ Defensive mistakes cost Spurs early on. ‘Not good enough,’ Sherwood added. ‘They didn’t have to work hard for their goals. There was no shouting or screaming at half-time. We made them aware it was individual mistakes’ It all leaves Pepe Mel still seeking his first home win as West Brom head coach. He was upset with the amount of injury-time allowed and admitted the players were ‘cross’ in the dressing-room. After the fall-out from the Cardiff match he did say it was only words, rather than punches, exchanged. ‘It’s the second time it’s happened and we needed the points,’ he said. ‘While we’ve worked very hard to get the goals we need to work hard on stopping goals.’ Albion started like a whirlwind, leaving the Spurs back line stunned. It was 1-0 after 26 seconds, 2-0 inside four minutes. Both goals came from the right wing Danny Rose was supposed to be patrolling. Morgan Amalfitano twisted inside the defender and fired a cross into the six-yard box. Hugo Lloris punched straight to Vydra who calmly finished into the unguarded net. Delight: Brunt and Graham Dorrans celebrate the second goal Wasted: With the score at 2-0 Adebayor had a chance to pull a goal back for Spurs but saw his penalty saved Clutched: Ben Fster was the Baggies\' hero as he sprawls to his left to save the shot Fight back: Harry Kane heads home Tottenham\'s second to start the fight back Belief: Tottenham players then had 20 minutes to complete a memorable comeback Comeback: Tim Sherwood watches as his team fought from three goals down to earn a point For the second, Steven Reid was afforded time and space by Rose to send a cross into the area. Sessegnon headed the ball upwards and Brunt sent a clinical volley into the corner. Spurs gathered themselves and hit back, with Kane guilty of a horrible miss from two yards after a Rose cross. They had an even better chance in the 15th minute when referee Neil Swarbrick pointed to the spot after Rose fell under a challenge from Amalfitano.Albion’s players were furious given that the contact was minor and Swarbrick had refused them three similar appeals. As it was Emmanuel Adebayor treated the spot-kick like a back-pass and Ben Foster gathered easily. Guilty: Danny Rose is booked for diving by Neil Swarbrick Hurdle: Adebayor skips out over the challenge from own goal scorer Jonas Olsson Off target: Kane reacts after a missed chance Slipped: Pepe Mel tries to encourage his team, but will be downtrodden at the result Spurs were unable to cope with high balls and Sessegnon made it three. Olsson kicked it long and Younes Kaboul’s attempted header diverted it into the path of Sessegnon, who outstripped Vlad Chiriches.Remarkably, West Brom had three times previously been 2-0 up inside 11 minutes this season and failed to win on each occasion. It seemed certain that widening the gap to three would end that run.But in the 34th minute Spurs got a glimmer of hope. Olsson tried to clear Kyle Naughton’s cross but looped the ball over Foster and after the interval Spurs proceeded to lay siege to the home goal.The match threatened to boil over when Rose was correctly booked for diving.He fell dramatically after pushing the ball past Reid in the area. After the card was shown, Kaboul raced 60 yards to remonstrate, barging into Olsson and swiping at Reid. He was lucky to escape any reprimand.Eventually the pressure told and Kane produced a strong header from Lennon’s cross to reduce the deficit. Suddenly the impossible seemed almost inevitable.Swarbrick signalled for six minutes of added time — a curious total given the lack of stoppages — and in the fourth of those Spurs levelled. Lennon dug out a cross on the right and the ball fell to Eriksen who sidestepped Reid and applied a quality finish into the top corner.

There was no shouting or screaming at half-time. We made them aware it was individual mistakes’<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">It all leaves Pepe Mel still seeking his first home win as West Brom head coach. He was upset with the amount of injury-time allowed and admitted the players were ‘cross’ in the dressing-room. After the fall-out from the Cardiff match he did say it was only words, rather than punches, exchanged. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">‘It’s the second time it’s happened and we needed the points,’ he said. ‘While we’ve worked very hard to get the goals we need to work hard on stopping goals.’<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Albion started like a whirlwind, leaving the Spurs back line stunned. It was 1-0 after 26 seconds, 2-0 inside four minutes. Both goals came from the right wing Danny Rose was supposed to be patrolling. Morgan Amalfitano twisted inside the defender and fired a cross into the six-yard box. Hugo Lloris punched straight to Vydra who calmly finished into the unguarded net.</font></p>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"><div class=\"artSplitter\"><div class=\"artSplitter\"><div class=\"artSplitter\"><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Delight: Brunt and Graham Dorrans celebrate the second goal\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"463\" id=\"i-ac570e88\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0DAF5A00000578-830_634x463.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Delight: Brunt and Graham Dorrans celebrate the second goal</p> </div><p> </p> <img alt=\"Wasted: With the score at 2-0 Adebayor had a chance to pull a goal back for Spurs but saw his penalty saved\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"420\" id=\"i-aa450e6d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0DB24F00000578-303_634x420.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Wasted: With the score at 2-0 Adebayor had a chance to pull a goal back for Spurs but saw his penalty saved</p> </div><p> </p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Clutched: Ben Fster was the Baggies\' hero as he sprawls to his left to save the shot\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"350\" id=\"i-9dcf0e47\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0DD2F600000578-73_634x350.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Clutched: Ben Fster was the Baggies\' hero as he sprawls to his left to save the shot</p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Fight back: Harry Kane heads home Tottenham\'s second to start the fight back\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"373\" id=\"i-a8450e63\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0E349300000578-933_634x373.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Fight back: Harry Kane heads home Tottenham\'s second to start the fight back</p> </div><p> </p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Belief: Tottenham players then had 20 minutes to complete a memorable comeback\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"447\" id=\"i-9b740e32\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0E345B00000578-10_634x447.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Belief: Tottenham players then had 20 minutes to complete a memorable comeback</p> </div><p> </p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Comeback: Tim Sherwood watches as his team fought from three goals down to earn a point\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"409\" id=\"i-aac50e7d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603098-1D0E0CA600000578-792_634x409.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Comeback: Tim Sherwood watches as his team fought from three goals down to earn a point</p> </div><p> </p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"></font><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">For the second, Steven Reid was afforded time and space by Rose to send a cross into the area.

It seemed certain that widening the gap to three would end that run.<br/>But in the 34th minute Spurs got a glimmer of hope. Olsson tried to clear Kyle Naughton’s cross but looped the ball over Foster and after the interval Spurs proceeded to lay siege to the home goal.<br/>The match threatened to boil over when Rose was correctly booked for diving.<br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">He fell dramatically after pushing the ball past Reid in the area. After the card was shown, Kaboul raced 60 yards to remonstrate, barging into Olsson and swiping at Reid. He was lucky to escape any reprimand.<br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Eventually the pressure told and Kane produced a strong header from Lennon’s cross to reduce the deficit. Suddenly the impossible seemed almost inevitable.<br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Swarbrick signalled for six minutes of added time — a curious total given the lack of stoppages — and in the fourth of those Spurs levelled. Lennon dug out a cross on the right and the ball fell to Eriksen who sidestepped Reid and applied a quality finish into the top corner.</font></p> <img alt=\"Chase: Substitute Saido Berhaino puts

Updated: 14:13 EST, 12 April 2014 0 View comments Borussia Dortmund condemned Bayern Munich to a second straight defeat in the Bundesliga, dismantling the champions 3-0 in their own Allianz Arena on Saturday. Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann scored the goals as Jurgen Klopp\'s side all but mathematically secured their place in the Champions League next season.  Painful: Pep Guardiola saw Bayern Munich suffer second successive league defeat Bayern\'s woes were compounded in stoppage time when Rafinha was shown a red card, although the defeat to their rivals from Westphalia was ultimately not so painful with still 17 points between the two sides at the top of the table. Earlier in the day, Wolfsburg came from behind to get the better of relegation-threatened Nurnberg 4-1 and move above Bayer Leverkusen into fourth place. Markus Feulner gave the visitors the lead, but two goals in three minutes from Ivica Olic and Ivan Perisic turned the game on its head.  Sharp shooter: Dortmund\'s Henrikh Mkhitaryan scores against Bayern Munich As a battling Nurnberg searched for an equaliser, Junior Malanda doubled the home team\'s advantage midway through the second half before Perisic grabbed his second and Wolfsburg\'s fourth of a dominant victory. Borussia Monchengladbach slipped out of the top four, and were grateful for a late equaliser from Juan Arango in their 1-1 draw at fourth-bottom Stuttgart. The Venezuelan\'s header looped past Sven Ulreich on 88 minutes after Stuttgart had led from the 12th minute through Daniel Didavi.  Emphatic: Borussia Dortmund\'s Jonas Hofmann scores third goal against Bayern Munich Mainz boosted their hopes of qualifying for next season\'s Europa League with a 3-0 win over Werder Bremen - a result which plunged the visitors back in the thick of relegation danger. An own goal from Nils Petersen set Mainz on their way to victory, with further goals from Christoph Moritz and Yunus Malli sealing the points before the interval and leaving Bremen just six points above the drop zone with four games left. Didier Ya Konan struck an 86th-minute winner to hand Hannover a huge 2-1 win over relegation rivals Hamburg. Ya Konan\'s goal put a dampener on HSV coach Mirko Slomka\'s return to Hannover, having been sacked from his post 107 days ago.  Job done: Jurgen Klopp\'s side all but secured place in Champions League next season Slomka\'s side had levelled through Hakan Calhanoglu\'s free-kick, which cancelled out Lars Stindl\'s opener. Freiburg also picked up a crucial three points in the battle for survival, winning 2-0 at home against Eintracht Braunschweig. An own goal from Damir Vrancic and one from Julian Schuster moved Christian Streich\'s side out of the bottom three with some room to breathe over their rivals below.    More...

The England centre, in only his fifth game back following a five-month lay off with a torn pectoral muscle, crossed for two of his side’s four tries to remind England coach Stuart Lancaster that Luther Burrell is not the only high-quality powerhouse centre available to him. ‘It was important to get the five points looking forward towards hopefully making the semi-final,’ Tuilagi said.  Double delight: Manu Tuilagi of Leicester scored twice to send a reminder to the England selectors   Danger man: Tuilagi of Leicester breaks clear with the ball at Welford Road  More...

It was really frustrating to be out for as long as I was. Watching your team-mates train while you’re in the physio room is hard. You just don’t feel like you’re part of the team. It’s been really frustrating.’ Leicester’s win, which was not always as comfortable as the final score line suggested, moves them to within two points of second placed east midland rivals Northampton, who face top-of-the-table Saracens on Sunday, while Tuilagi’s return to form could not have come at a better time. His first try came from a flat pass across the gain line from scrum-half Ben Youngs which allowed the centre to crash over under the posts while his second, early in the second half, saw him swat aside James Short before powering over with three Wasps defenders on his back. With Luther Burrell excelling in the England No13 shirt during the Six Nations, Tuilagi’s performance at inside centre yesterday will have impressed Lancaster.  Fijian flyer: Vereniki Goneva of Leicester breaks clear to score a try on the day he agreed a new contract   Wales hopeful: Owen Williams of Leicester takes on Ed Jackson at Welford Road  ‘I’m just as happy at 12 or 13,’ Tuilagi said. ‘If I was picked on the wing for England I’d be happy.’ Fijian winger Niki Goneva, who earlier in the day signed a contract extension, scored one Leicester’s other try before replacement David Mele claimed the bonus-point score with two minutes left on the clock. ‘It was a case of ‘job done’,’ said Tigers boss Richard Cockerill. ‘It wasn’t much of an event but we’ll take the five points. It’s nice to have Manu back playing like that.’ Leicester and England lock Geoff Parling made his first appearance following a six-month injury lay-off to provide Lancaster and Cockerill with another boost. Wasps’ main focus now is trying to claim seventh place in order to gain the final European spot for next season and next week’s Twickenham clash now takes on huge significance for both clubs. ‘We’re disappointed we didn’t even get a bonus point,’ said Wasps boss Dai Young, whose side’s only try came through flanker Guy Thompson. ‘Momentum is massive in this game and if we’d have come here and had our trousers pulled down it wouldn’t have done us any good for next week.’  Skipper: Ed Slater of Leicester breaks through the Wasps defence in the Aviva Premiership match   On the charge: Jordan Crane of Leicester is tackled by Nathan Hughes (L) and Guy Thompson    More...

Mickelson, who posted a pair of sevens during Thursday\'s opening-round 76, finished outside the cut by one stroke, undone by a triple-bogey six at the par-three 12th. \'I just had one bad hole there at 12,\' said the 43-year-old left-hander. \'And I keep making these triples.

Garcia and Watson are pretty in pink The reigning Open champion, one of the most popular players among the galleries at Augusta National, has been a consistent performer at the Masters with 10 top-five finishes and 14 top-10s in his 21 previous visits. Mickelson said that outside of those three holes, he played solid golf and had no excuses. \'Why couldn\'t I get it going? I don\'t really have a great answer for you,\' he told reporters. \'I\'ve actually played reasonably well for a majority of the holes and then the ones that I let slide I end up making a big number. So it\'s tough to overcome those big numbers.\' Mickelson spent most of his time at the pesky 12th, the shortest hole at Augusta, playing in the sand. \'What happened at 12 was I hit in the front bunker and there was no sand where I was at,\' explained Mickelson, who contended he could not slide his wedge far enough under the ball. \'I caught the liner of the bunker and bladed it across the green and the same thing happened on the other side. It went back and forth, three bunkers, before I finally got it to stay on grass.\'  All in vain: The three-time Masters champion hits his approach on the second hole on Friday   Off the leaderboard: Mickelson was unable to hit the heights after several big scores this week   Cut: The American legend walks off the 18th green after failing with his final birdie attempt of the week  Mickelson needed a big finish to slip inside the cut line of four under par. Lefty put on a desperate charge, registering three birdies in four holes from the 14th and needed another birdie at the 18th to qualify for the last two rounds. Mickelson found the final green with his approach, but it bounded far past the cup leaving him a monster putt for birdie which he was unable to convert, taking a par for 73 and a five-over 149 total. Asked if he would watch the rest of the tournament on television, Mickelson said: \'I probably will. It will kind of be my punishment.  Early exit: Britain\'s Luke Donald also missed the cut after picking up a two-stroke penalty  Jason Dufner, who won the US PGA title last summer, missed the cut with rounds of 80 and 74, for an aggregate score of  10-over par. Britain’s Luke Donald also went home, counting the cost of a two-shot penalty for grounding a club in a bunker. ‘As soon as I did it, I knew that wasn’t the right thing to do,’ said Donald after he followed his first round 79 with a 70. ‘It was stupid on  my part.’   More...

Worcester were languishing 21-3 behind at one stage but fought back bravely to get two bonus points, through four tries and finishing within seven points of the Chiefs. Scrum-half Dave Lewis, centre Sam Hill, fly-half Gareth Steenson and hooker Jack Yeandle got first-half tries for Exeter, while full-back Chris Pennell and David Lemi crossed for Worcester.

Bonus points: David Lemi of Worcester Warriors celebrates his try against Exeter Chiefs   Touchdown! Chris Pennell of Worcester Warriors crosses for a try in front of a home crowd  Lewis raced over for the first after nine minutes as he nipped past home prop Ofa Fainga\'anuku to race to the line, with Pennell forlornly chasing. Steenson converted but Lamb added Worcester\'s opening points with a 40-metre penalty. Hill\'s try soon followed as he was put over from two metres by his fly-half after an initial charge from Fetu\'u Vainikolo, and with Steenson converting, Exeter\'s lead was stretched again. It got worse for Worcester as Lamb missed another long-range attempt before Steenson rounded off another break into home territory for his own converted try. Catch me if you can: Carl Rimmerbeaks away leaving Warriors in his wake   The Worcester defence was almost non-existent and, when they had some possession inside the opposition 22, the Chiefs stood strong. It seemed how many for the Chiefs. But suddenly the game was on. Worcester grabbed their first try when scrum-half Jonny Arr fed Pennell to score. Then wing Lemi kicked upfield from just inside his own half and followed up to beat wing Matt Jess for pace and grab the converted try.  Pile driver: Sam Betty evades Exeter\'s Gareth Steensonto as the Warriors stage a thrilling comeback  Exeter dented the comeback, though, as Yeandle scored two tries either side of the break, both converted by Steenson, to put his side in command, the first of which also claimed the try bonus point. But Worcester, to their credit, would not lay down. Lamb booted a penalty just before Yeandle\'s second score.  Helping hand: Augustin Creevy of Worcester passes out of the tackle by Matt Jess of Exeter  Creevy\'s 53rd-minute try, that his stand-off converted, plus Lemi\'s second on the left moments - all after Exeter replacement James Scaysbrook was sin-binned for pulling down a maul on his own line - gave the Warriors a try bonus point. The momentum had switched and Worcester had Exeter on the rack even when they were back up to a full complement of players. And, after Lamb\'s third penalty put Worcester within five points, the match came down to one cross kick by the fly-half which wing Josh Drauniniu failed to grab with the line at his mercy to finish a great game.

Ben Pomeroy and Vincent Duport also crossed for two tries each in the Super League rout, which was on the cards from the early stages. The home side almost scored after 60 seconds and would have but for a last-gasp tackle by Paddy Flynn on Morgan Escare.  Rout: Elliott Whitehead crossed for his first try triple for Catalan Dragons in their flogging of Widnes    The Dragons did open the scoring on five minutes though, Eloi Pelissier scooting away from the acting half and offloading to Pomeroy who barged his way over to score. Thomas Bosc missed the goal. Five minutes later, and Catalan were in again, Jason Baitieri and Olivier Elima doing the hard work in the middle before Eloi Pelissier and Leon Pryce combined to send Whitehead in for his first try of the afternoon. Bosc again missed the conversion. Catalan scored their third and best try of the match in the 17th minute, Escare and Daryl Millard combining to go the length of the field as they returned Kevin Brown\'s kick down-field. Bosc this time added the goal to take the score to 14-0.   More...

Danny Tickle missed the goal. Widnes narrowed the gap to four points as Jack Owens pounced on Brown\'s kick to the right, with Tickle\'s conversion narrowing the Catalan lead. Catalan coach Laurent Frayssinous looked furious as he marched pitch-side to blast his troops. That appeared to work as Whitehead latched onto Pryce\'s pass to scored his second try of the afternoon. Bosc missed another shot at goal. After half-time, the home side ran riot, Duport scoring seven minutes in after a long pass from Whitehead. Bosc again missed the goal. Pomeroy scored his second 10 minutes later, powering his way over from short range from Escare\'s pass. Escare missed the goal. From the restart, Dragons pounced on a Brown error, Whitehead picking up the loose ball and racing 40 metres to score under the posts. Bosc converted to take the scores to 32-10. With 14 minutes remaining, Widnes registered a consolation effort, Flynn offloading for Lloyd White to score in the corner. Tickle converted the goal.      Catalan quickly stamped their authority back on the game, Duport chasing his own kick through to score down the right. Escare converted to take the scores to 38-16. Catalan went back up the field and threw the ball around for fun, Millard the next scorer five minutes from time, Pryce and Garcia sending the winger in at the corner. Escare missed the conversion. Widnes were well beaten but had the final say on the scoreboard, Hep Cahill sending Owens in for his second try in the left corner, Tickle failing to add the touchline conversion.  More...

Kevin McDonald and Dave Edwards grabbed the decisive goals for Kenny Jackett\'s men. The game drifted away from Crewe in the closing stages of the first half with Chuks Aneke sent off moments after McDonald had opened the scoring.  Going up: Wolves celebrate promotion after a 2-0 win at Crewe Alexandra  Rock ans roll: Former lead singer of Led Zeppelin and Wolves fan Robert Plant (centre) celebrates promotion Second-placed Brentford slipped up as they went down 1-0 at Swindon, where Louis Thompson scored the only goal. Michael Smith had earlier missed a penalty for the Robins. The Bees still have a seven-point advantage over third-placed Leyton Orient but their frustration was compounded when Adam Forshaw was dismissed for two bookable offences. Orient moved into third on the back of a 5-1 thrashing of Gillingham at the Matchroom Stadium. David Mooney scored two for the east London team with Dean Cox, Kevin Lisbie and Chris Dagnall also on target before Craig Fagan hit a late Gills consolation.

The home side had two players sent off - substitute prop Sila Puafisi and scrum-half Tavis Knoyle - while they also finished the game with centre Mike Tindall and hooker Huia Edmonds in the sin-bin. Bath, who had three players yellow-carded themselves, prevailed through a 79th-minute penalty try - converted by fly-half George Ford - after Gloucester collapsed a maul. It was Bath\'s first league win at Kingsholm since 2006.

Bath forwards Carl Fearns, Matt Garvey and Dave Attwood were all yellow-carded, meaning Bath played 30 minutes of the game a man down, while the game went to uncontested scrums shortly after Puafisi departed. Tonga international Puafisi received a red card from referee Tim Wigglesworth for a dangerous high tackle on Bath full-back Nick Abendanon, then Wales international Knoyle was sent off after he threw punches at Bath number eight Leroy Houston. The Knoyle incident provided a spiteful end to a contest when neither side took a backward step, and Bath remain fourth going into next week\'s home appointment with relegation favourites Worcester. Gloucester boss Nigel Davies made four changes from the side beaten by Amlin Challenge Cup quarter-final opponents Wasps last weekend, including number eight Gareth Evans replacing England international Ben Morgan, and Tindall returning in midfield. Bath, meanwhile, welcomed back Test props Paul James and David Wilson, with a solitary switch behind the scrum seeing Kyle Eastmond taking over from centre Gavin Henson. Wales hooker Richard Hibbard, one of Gloucester\'s major signings for next term, was among a bumper crowd that saw Twelvetrees kick his team into an early lead.  Trouble: A plastic bottle appears to be thrown in the direction of match officials as they make their way down the tunnel   Sin bin: Referee Tim Wigglesworth shows Huia Edmonds of Gloucester a yellow card during the Aviva Premiership match  The visitors continued to press following a Matt Banahan kick deep into Gloucester\'s 22, yet they were denied a try for wing Horacio Agulla - hat-trick hero of last Sunday\'s Amlin Challenge Cup quarter-final victory over Brive - when Wigglesworth ruled midfield obstruction. And that was the cue for Gloucester to regroup as they responded impressively through two more Twelvetrees penalties during a three-minute spell that also saw Fearns sin-binned following a technical infringement. Bath only had themselves to blame as Wigglesworth punished their poor discipline - James proved a consistent transgressor - yet Ford\'s second penalty made it 9-6 as half-time approached. It proved a false dawn from Bath\'s perspective, though, and Fearns\' fellow flanker Garvey was yellow-carded just before the break for a high tackle on Evans that could yet attract attention from the match citing commissioner. Evans was forced off injured as a result of the challenge, and Morgan entered the action with Gloucester three points clear halfway through a typically feisty derby.  Boiling point: Fighting breaks out between the Gloucester and Bath players after Bath are awarded a penalty try   Rising above: Bath captain Stuart Hooper claims clean ball in the line-out  Matters deteriorated early in the second period for Gloucester when Puafisi received his marching orders just eight minutes after going on as a replacement for Shaun Knight. Abendanon was able to continue after treatment, but Bath then wiped out Gloucester\'s advantage when Hooper was driven over from a lineout to claim a try which had been on the cards once Puafisi was dismissed. Ford missed the conversion, and then the game went to an unedifying sight of uncontested scrums as Gloucester had run out of tighthead prop options. But Bath could not make the game safe, and they completed a trio of yellow cards when Attwood was sin-binned for not rolling away after a tackle. Wigglesworth allowed neither side a chance to build momentum, yet Gloucester had Twelvetrees\' goalkicking to fall back on, and his fourth successful penalty edged the home team back in front before a dramatic finish unfolded that was littered with red and yellow cards.

12:48 EST, 12 April 2014 7 shares 3 View comments Burnley\'s Premier League party was put on hold after Jacob Butterfield\'s strike condemned the Clarets to a 1-0 defeat against Middlesbrough at Turf Moor as Derby beat Huddersfield. A win for Sean Dyche\'s side, and a defeat for the Rams, could have guaranteed automatic promotion back to the top flight for the first time since the 2009/10 season. But the Rams won comfortably against Huddersfield, while Burnley came unstuck against an in-form Boro side who have won now won four games on the spin. Both sides struggled to dominate the opening minutes but it was Burnley who looked the more threatening.

That move sparked Dyche\'s men into life and they came close to breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute. Kieran Trippier burst down the right channel and produced a trademark inch-perfect delivery to Danny Ings but the striker was unable to hit the target with his left-footed volley. Despite the pressure, Aitor Karanka\'s men showed their attacking prowess in the 19th minute - Lee Tomlin finding space on the edge of the box before rifling an effort just wide of Tom Heaton\'s post. But moments later the Clarets thought they had broken the deadlock after Kightly\'s looping header beat Dimi Konstantopoulos but hit the bar, Barnes followed up but failed to hit the target.  Tight tussle: Burnley\'s Ashley Barnes (right) battles to dispossess Middlesbrough\'s Butterfield Spectacular: Ben Mee takes flight for a bicycle attempt while Danny Ings gets primed to head towards goal Pressing hard: Ings challenges Middlesbrough\'s Dean Whitehead for possession in the box    Much of the same continued and neat link-up play between Dean Marney and Ings presented the latter with a glorious chance for his 21st league goal of the season.However, determined defending from Nathaniel Chalobah somehow ensured the striker\'s effort trickled wide. Shortly after, Albert Adomah surged into the Burnley half and down the right flank and found Danny Graham just yards out - but his first-time volley flashed over the bar. After the interval, the hosts came out pressing and should have scored when Kightly weaved into the box and found Ings but Adomah somehow blocked his effort. But Butterfield sent the away crowd into ecstasy in the 51st minute. Tomlin carried the ball into the Burnley half and released Butterfield, who made no mistake to calmly slot his left-footed strike past Heaton. High hopes: Kieran Trippier\'s Clarets will have to wait to celebrate their likely promotion to the Premier League Denied: Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos saves a shot from Burnley\'s Ashley Barnes Both ends: Goal stopper and scorer Konstantopoulos (right) and Butterfield embrace after the match   It was almost 2-0 four minutes later as Tomlin curled his effort wide but Burnley looked to respond and almost equalised on 72 minutes, Trippier again charging forward and finding Ings - the striker\'s snap-shot going wide to Dyche\'s despair. The hosts continued to press and came close again in the closing stages but Ings again failed to convert from Trippier\'s teasing cross. Konstantopoulos remained unflappable in the Boro goal and despite the dismissal of defender Daniel Ayala late on, they were not to be denied another impressive scalp.    More...

Fight, however, is something his team does not boast at present. As a consequence, for the first time this season the 2,900 travelling fans sounded their dissent in the direction of the manager, who was seated in the stands serving the sixth game of his seven-match touchline ban for headbutting Hull City\'s David Meyler. \'We want Pardew out\' was the audible accompaniment to the banners which read, \'No more excuses. No more lies. Pardew out\' and, quite charmingly, \'Pardew is a muppet\'.

Newcastle fans unveil Pardew out banners ahead of kick-off at the Britannia Stadium  Danger man: Man of the match Marko Arnautovic wreaked havoc on the Newcastle defence Out of little: City\'s Dutch defender Pieters just before he unleashes the cross that wins the match Heads up: Newcastle\'s Mike Williamson\'s ducks down to Peter Crouch\'s raised boot Chance: Newcastle\'s Dutch midfielder Vurnon Anita (left) heads over the bar   Early dig: Newcastle fans hold a sign saying \'Pardew is a Muppet\' as the teams come out of the tunnel Good day out: Ryan Shawcross became the first player to play 200 Premier League games for the club Handful: Lanky frontman Crouch puts himself about in the box against Williamson Unleashed: Newcastle\'s Yoan Gouffran shoots as Glenn Whelan tries to shut him down  Erik Pieters sized a cross from the left, skewed his delivery and watched in glee as it sailed above and beyond Dutch compatriot Tim Krul. United had earlier been denied what looked a clear penalty when Geoff Cameron clumsily barged into Papiss Cisse. And Pardew, whose side are without a goal in six hours, went on: \'The goal was a bit of a fluke and the wind caught hold of it, which made it almost impossible for Tim to save. \'But we should have had a penalty and that was a big turning point for us. We need a goal and that would have been a nice opportunity.\' The concession was United\'s 12th since they last scored a league goal of their own and sparked the anti-Pardew chants.  Boost: Returning from injury, Krul saves a diving header from Stoke striker Peter Crouch   Under fire: The pressure is now heaped on Newcastle boss Alan Pardew after the side fourth loss in a row   No uncertain terms: Some travelling Toon fans made their feelings about Pardew clear with banners   Can\'t look up: Newcastle\'s Adam Armstrong (left) and Krul walk off the pitch heads bowed after the loss  Stoke\'s victory, meanwhile, takes them to within three points of their ninth-placed opponents. Austrian wideman Marko Arnautovic terrorised the visitors throughout, twice serving up crosses for Peter Crouch who saw his headers denied a goal - first by a post and then the gloves of Krul. Potters boss Mark Hughes said: \'I thought he (Arnautovic) was excellent. We were able to get him in situations where he can show his talent. \'In terms of his ability to cross the ball on the run he is one of the best I\'ve seen do that, it\'s a real quality not too many players have.\'    More...

Hot on the heels of their rivals, the in-form visitors made the 48-mile trip to Huish Park two points outside the Sky Bet Championship top six and came up against a side they had beaten eight times in their last 10 meetings. Cherries winger Matt Ritchie scored twice inside the opening 20 minutes to inspire his side to victory against Reading on Tuesday, and the 24-year-old should have notched another early opener on two minutes but blazed Lewis Grabban\'s cross over the bar. However, it was Yeovil - who came into the match six points from safety - that shaded an open first half and nearly snatched an early lead when Joe Edwards evaded Ian Harte and pulled the back to James Hayter, but the ex-Bournemouth striker fluffed his lines.  Breakthrough: Yeovil\'s Kieffer Moore celebrates opening the scoring against Bournemouth at Huish Park Blast: Moore drives his right-footed shot goalward as the Glovers take the lead Elated: The Yeovil players in raptures after Moore found the net but didn\'t last and they remain second bottom  Match factsYeovil Town: Stech, Ayling, McAllister, Palazuelos, Webster, Duffy, Lawrence, Edwards, Hayter (Hoskins 91\'), Moore, RallsSubs: Dawson, Hoskins, Lanzoni, Davis, Grant, Dunn, Ofori-TwumasiGoal: MooreBooked: McAllisterAFC Bournemouth: Camp, Francis, Harte (Smith 57\'), O\'Kane, Elphick, Cook, Ritchie, Surman, Kermorgant, Grabban (Pitman 68\'), Fraser (Rantie 80\')Subs: Allsop, Pugh, MacDonald, Ward, RantieGoal: FraserBooked: Francis, CookClick HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Championship The visitors had found the net 14 times in their previous five matches before arriving in Somerset, and their attacking prowess was evident when Fraser, who replaced Marc Pugh in Eddie Howe\'s only change from Tuesday\'s win, called Marek Stech into action with a low shot. With the Yeovil fans and players growing increasingly irate at referee Robert Madley, their anger turned to joy on 25 minutes when former Dorchester striker Moore threatened to derail Bournemouth\'s late promotion charge. A seemingly routine free-kick into the Cherries box by Jamie McAllister was headed clear but fell to Moore at the edge of the box, and the youngster rifled an unstoppable volley into the top corner. Bournemouth responded well and ended the first half strongly with the lively Grabban spurning two good chances before the break, twice firing wide after good work from Ritchie and strike partner Yann Kermorgant.   Got the edge: Cherries\' Ryan Fraser (right) finds the net for the Cherries\' equaliser Saving blushes: Fraser (left) and teammates celebrate his freak goal that made the score 1-1  Shortly after half-time, the visitors thought they should have had a penalty after Byron Webster appeared to handle in the area, but moments later drew level through a freak goal. With the Cherries turning the screw, Webster attempted to clear from inside his own box but the ball cannoned into Fraser and looped over Stech and into the net. With four games now left to decide their fate, Yeovil responded well to the setback as Moore dragged a shot narrowly wide before Bournemouth winger Ritchie threatened to complete a quickfire comeback for the visitors. Eyeing a sixth successive league win, the Cherries poured forward in search for a late winner but almost left themselves open at the back when Manchester United loanee Tom Lawrence weaved his way into the box, but his curling shot crept wide as the match gradually petered out.

opposing his management. Pardew, who is still serving a touchline ban for headbutting Hull\'s David Meyler, was greeted with one banner that said: \'No more lies or excuses. Pardew out\' and another that called him a \'muppet\'. Newcastle are sitting safely in mid-table but are enduring a miserable run of performances. Pardew: We lack creative flair and ability in and around the box  Pardew out: Newcastle fans unveiled banners in opposition to Alan Pardew\'s management against Stoke   Muppet: These fans also packed a homemade banner for Pardew  They have won just four of their last 15 matches, failing to score in 11 of those, serving up dross in the absence of star man Loic Remy. Since Newcastle beat Stoke 5-1 on Boxing Day, Newcastle have scored just two goals in eight matches at St James\' Park. They laboured to 1-0 victories against strugglers Aston Villa and Crystal Palace and have been well beaten by Manchester United, Tottenham and Everton in recent weeks. Speaking to the Newcastle Evening Chronicle ahead of the match against Stoke, Pardew said he was \'not enjoying\' the criticism that has come in the last couple of weeks.  Criticised: Alan Pardew - at St James\' Park last week - said he was \'not enjoying\' the criticism he was facing   Struggling: Newcastle have won just four of their last 15 matches going into today\'s game  \'I am not enjoying it – you do not want criticism,\' he said. \'However, you have to accept it, particularly in this job. I think you have to be resilient. It is a word I have been using with the players. \'We have lost a bit of resilience in our play. I cannot lose that otherwise I really am in trouble.

The City captain, widely acknowledged to be one of the best defenders in Europe, looked to have injured his knee after landing awkwardly and his absence would be a huge blow for Manuel Pellegrini\'s team. This is especially true given City are coming up against the Premier League\'s top scorers, with 90 goals, not to mention Liverpool\'s prolific strikeforce of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge.  Crocked: Man City captain Vincent Kompany limps out of training after a collision with Micah Richards   Painful: Both Kompany (left) and Micah Richards lie on the floor after their mid-air collision in training Pellegrini: An excess of anxiety could mean more mistakes  The Uruguayan has already notched 29 Premier League this season, while Sturridge has 20, and they\'ll fancy their chances of adding to that should Kompany miss tomorrow\'s clash. Martin Demichelis would have been expected to line up alongside Kompany at the heart of the City defence. But should Kompany fail to recover, then either Joleon Lescott or Javi Garcia will most likely deputise.   More...

His concerned team-mates were quick to rush to his aid as he clutched his left knee, with Yaya Toure helping the City captain up off the ground. Samir Nasri then helped Kompany off the training ground. Third-placed City are four points behind league leaders Liverpool with two games in hand. But were the Reds to win tomorrow, even victory in their two extra matches would still leave City a point behind Brendan Rodgers\' men.

Jordan Rhodes, Craig Conway and Michael Keane scored for the visitors with Lewis Buxton and Atdhe Nuhiu, with a double, replying for Wednesday in front of 22,792 fans in the Sky Bet Championship. The day marked the 25th anniversary of the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans who had been killed in a crush inside Hillsborough at the FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest on April 15, 1989.  Respect: 96 blue seats at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough are replaced by 96 white seats to represent the 96 Liverpool fans who died at the Hillsborough disaster   Honoured: Flowers are laid as a tribute outside the ground before the Championship match at Hillsborough Level: Atdhe Nuhiu races off to celebrate after scoring Sheffield Wednesday\'s 90th minute equaliser  Match factsSheffield Wednesday: Kirkland, Buxton, Onyewu, Llera,Mattock (Helan 60), Maguire, Lee, Palmer (Lavery 59),Hutchinson (Afobe 79), Antonio, Nuhiu.Subs Not Used: Jermaine, Johnson, Coke, Taylor, Martinez.Booked: Llera,Hutchinson,Nuhiu,Afobe.Goals: Buxton 30,Nuhiu 72,90.Blackburn: Robinson, Keane, Kilgallon, Hanley, Spurr, Cairney, Lowe, Williamson, Conway, Rhodes (Varney 90),Gestede.Subs Not Used: Kane, King, Eastwood, Olsson,Taylor, Feeney.Booked: Hanley,Williamson,Gestede,Rhodes.Goals: Rhodes 15,Conway 36,Keane 43.Att: 22,792Ref: Fred GrahamClick HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Championship That game had been called off after six minutes when the horror that was unfolding had become apparent to the referee, with fans climbing the fences at the Leppings Lane end and crowding on to the pitch. Saturday\'s game kicked off at seven minutes past three, as with all games in the Premier League, Football League and Conference this weekend, after a mintue\'s silence had been impeccably observed. Wednesday coach Stuart Gray and Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer had laid wreaths behind the goal in front of the West Stand and a Liverpool shirt and scarf were also placed there. Wednesday had marked the day by changing 96 blue seats to white and placing a single red rose on each on the lower tier of the stand at the same end of the ground. Blackburn were the first to threaten but Jason Lowe fired wide across the goal from the edge of the area. Wednesday\'s Chris Maguire forced a corner when his shot from distance was deflected wide. Blackburn went ahead after 11 minutes when the Wednesday defence failed to clear a ball into the box and Rhodes had the simple job of rounding Chris Kirkland before slotting the ball into the empty net. Wednesday had their best chance so far when Liam Palmer chased a through ball but was beaten to it by Paul Robinson. They went even closer when Michail Antonio set up Nuhiu but his shot from the edge of the area was beaten away by Robinson. With 28 minutes gone Robinson again kept his side ahead when he brilliantly tipped a header from Antonio over the bar. Wednesday were not to be denied and, from the corner by Maguire, Buxton came in at the far post and forced the ball in.  Thriller: Sheffield Wednesday\'s Atdhe Nuhiu (right) races off to celebrate after scoring his team\'s third goal  Wednesday were enjoying more of the pressure but the visitors went ahead again when the ball fell to Conway and he fired low and hard inside Kirkland\'s right-hand post. Blackburn got a third when Jason Lowe crossed and Keane got up well to head past Kirkland 10 minutes before half-time. Rhodes again had the ball in the net with 53 minutes on the clock but was rightly given offside before he fired high across Kirkland and into the roof of the net as rain lashed down at Hillsborough. Kirkland did well to twice deny Rovers on the hour, first getting down well to his right to stop Rhodes who gathered a chipped ball over the defence.  Aerial battle: Tom Cairney (left) and Sheffield Wednesday\'s Lewis Buxton challenge for a header   Battle: Sheffield Wednesday\'s Michail Antonio (left) is tackled by Blackburn Rovers\' Jordan Rhodes  Rhodes claimed the loose ball and cut it back for Rudy Gestede but again Kirkland kept the effort out. Antonio almost caught Robinson out when his cross hit the far post and Caolan Lavery could not get much power behind his hooked follow-up which he hit into the ground and Robinson gathered. Wednesday got a second and it owed a lot to the persistence of Antonio who powered down the left and went the long way around Keane before firing a low cross. Robinson got his hand to the ball but it bounced up for Nuhiu to force in from close range with 17 minutes remaining.  Heated: Sam Hutchinson (centre) and Lee Williamson go head to head during the Championship clash  Rudy Gestede fired over after Rhodes had beaten Oguchi Onyewu to the loose ball and laid off to his strike partner. Rhodes fired into the side netting after gathering from a poor clearance by the Wednesday defence as Blackburn continued to look the more likely to add to the score. They were made to pay in the dying moments of added time when the visitors failed to clear from a Wednesday attack and Nuhiu hit his second goal high into the roof of the net from 12 yards. Nuhiu almost claimed his third and Wednesday\'s fourth but Robinson beat away his shot and both teams had to settle for a point.   More...

Murphy, a £1million buy from Crewe in the summer, has struggled to live up to his price tag this season but he was outstanding as Leeds ended a run of five defeats. Two teams in desperate need of a win after a dismal run of form elected to play five men across the midfield.  Double: Luke Murphy scored twice as Leeds won their first game under new owner Massimo Cellino Dejection: Blackpool boss Barry Ferguson looks on after the first goal  Match factsLeeds: Butland, Wootton, Lees, Zaliukas (White 81), Pearce, Warnock, Tonge, Brown, Murphy, Smith (Hunt 65), McCormack.Subs Not Used: Pugh, Poleon, Stewart, Cairns, Mowatt.Goals: Murphy 21,73.Blackpool: Gilks, McMahon, MacKenzie, Cathcart, Robinson, Basham (Haroun 67), Ferguson, Perkins, Bishop, Halliday (Keogh 74), Goodwillie.Subs Not Used: Osbourne, Halstead, Barkhuizen, Dobbie, Grandin.Booked: Halliday.Att: 23,416Ref: David Coote (Nottinghamshire).Click HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Championship Leeds, without a goal in their previous three matches, threatened to break the spell when Murphy burst into the penalty box in the 14th minute but Craig Cathcart completed an immaculately timed tackle. Murphy, back in the starting line-up after three games on the bench, justified manager Brian McDermott\'s faith by opening the scoring after 21 minutes. Tom Lees\' high ball was nodded down to Ross McCormack by Matt Smith. McCormack played the ball across to goalmouth to Murphy, who switched it onto his left foot on the corner of the six-yard box and steered it past keeper Matt Gilks for his first goal since the opening day of the season. It was Leeds\' first goal in 319 minutes of football and they continued to put Blackpool\'s defence under pressure. Former Crewe midfielder Murphy was again to the fore as he released Scott Wootton down the right and his cross was headed just wide of the far post by McCormack. Blackpool, with just two wins from their previous 25 matches, should have equalised in the 35th minute. Tony McMahon motored down the right and the unmarked Neal Bishop powered a header just over the bar from 15 yards.  Hooked: Jason Pearce clears the ball with Andy Halliday bearing down  David Goodwillie, playing alone up front for the Tangerines, sent an angled shot wide with the defence in disarray but Leeds nearly doubled their lead in the 43rd minute. The lively Murphy was barged to the ground by David Perkins just outside the box and Gilks spilled Michael Tonge\'s driven free-kick before gathering it to his chest in the nick of time. Leeds looked vulnerable at the back and Chris Basham just failed to turn Goodwillie\'s low centre into the net soon after the interval. Noel Hunt was booed by Leeds fans when he left the bench to replace Smith inthe 65th minute and - two minutes later - Blackpool replaced Basham with Belgian Faris Haroun.  Silence: Players and fans at Elland Road mark the anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster  Murphy\'s second goal arrived in the 73rd minute. Hunt headed on another long ball from Lees and this time Murphy neatly dinked the ball over Gilks with his right foot from eight angled yards. Leeds keeper Jack Butland denied Blackpool a consolation goal by stretching to tip Gary MacKenzie\'s header over the bar with five minutes left.   More...

Watford travelled to Millwall in the thick of a fruitful spell in front of goal, and Lewis McGugan put them ahead inside the opening 20 minutes, but Steve Morison - introduced by Lions boss Ian Holloway at half-time - drew the hosts level midway through the second half and appeared to have salvaged a point. Almen Abdi then thought he had had the final say when he restored the Hornets\' lead four minutes from time, but Woolford struck in the fifth added minute to halt Waford\'s play-off push.With both teams needing a win for their respective end-of-season ambitions, the game began at a frantic pace as Carlos Edwards fired over from 20 yards early on. Millwall players celebrate Martyn Woolford\'s dramatic late equaliser  The first big chance fell to Gabriele Angella, but the Watford centre-half could only glance McGugan\'s inviting corner just wide of the far post from six yards.

McGugan\'s dummy allowed Deeney to back-heel the ball back into the midfielder\'s path before driving home past David Forde from 20 yards for his 10th goal of the season. Watford could have doubled their lead moments later but Ford was out quickly to block Deeney\'s close-range effort on the angle. That shocked Millwall into life and the hosts should have levelled before the break, but Owen Garvan could only shoot straight at Manuel Almunia from Stefan Maierhofer\'s low cross. The hosts began the second half on top with Maierhofer heading over from six yards on 55 minutes after meeting Lee Martin\'s outswinging free-kick. And Millwall finally got their reward shortly after when second-half substitute Morison volleyed home from the angle following Woolford\'s corner. As the hosts pushed for the winner the game became stretched, and Fernando Forestieri should have reclaimed the lead for the visitors on the break but his low drive struck the legs of Forde. Having brought three strikers on, Holloway was desperate for the three points and Nicky Bailey was inches from a spectacular 25-yard winner but was denied by the fingertips of Almunia.

But Milwall kept coming and Woolford snatched a dramatic last-minute equaliser, squeezing his left-footed effort through Almunia, to earn his side a much-deserved point.

Derby had started with the confidence of a team almost guaranteed a top-six finish, and they nearly scored in the third minute when a Russell volley from outside the area was blocked one-handed by Smithies and Richard Keogh scooped the rebound over the bar. Clarke was booked two minutes later for a deliberate trip which halted a Will Hughes run, but the visitors had claims for a penalty waved aside by referee Darren Deadman when Danny Ward went over in the ninth minute. However, Ward was smiling five minutes later when he provided the low cross from the right which travelled all the way to the back post, where Wells had a simple tap-in from two yards. Derby almost conceded again in the 20th minute when a mistake by Keogh allowed Wells to run into the box, but Lee Grant raced out to deny the striker his second goal. It was a big moment because, eight minutes later, Derby were level when a George Thorne pass sliced Huddersfield open and Russell cleverly flicked the ball over Smithies from just inside the box. Huddersfield were reduced to 10 men two minutes before the interval when Lynch, who had already been booked for time wasting, caught Patrick Bamford late on the left touchline and was shown a second yellow card.  Seeing red: Referee Darren Deadman sends off Huddersfield\'s Peter Clarke (5)  Bamford was able to continue after treatment and wasted a great chance when he blazed over from 10 yards, but the advantage was now with Derby and they were literally given a helping hand by Smithies in the 50th minute. A cross from Craig Forsyth was totally misjudged by the keeper, who palmed the ball one-handed into his own net. And it got even worse for Huddersfield, who had Clarke sent off for the foul which also earned Derby a penalty. The defender clearly caught Hughes and, after Clarke had been shown his second yellow, Martin sent Smithies the wrong way with a spot-kick into the bottom left corner.   More...

EST, 12 April 2014 0 View comments Luke Chambers snatched three points to lift Ipswich Town to within the cusp of the Sky Bet Championship play-offs after scoring late on to mark a thrilling end to their 2-1 win over Doncaster Rovers. Daryl Murphy\'s 13th of the season gave Ipswich the lead shortly after the restart but it looked like their top-six hopes would be dented after Chris Brown equalised from an 82nd-minute penalty. But three minutes later, Ipswich skipper Chambers hammered home to move Ipswich into seventh, level with sixth-placed Brighton.

They went even closer in the 14th minute when left-back Tyrone Mings - making only his fifth ever Championship start - tested Sam Johnstone from 25 yards, the Doncaster keeper fortunate to see the rebound cleared from danger. Ipswich should have taken the lead in the 20th minute when Anderson showed great pace to streak away from Abdoulaye Meite, but his first-time cross was slid just wide from Hunt. Doncaster were far from out of it with a grounded Brown bringing a save from Ipswich keeper Dean Gerken before Gabriel Tamas was given far too much room in the Town area and his powerful header was turned around by Gerken. The best chance of the first half fell to the home side in injury time when Hunt\'s wicked inswinging free-kick was headed goalwards by Tommy Smith but Johnstone produced a fantastic diving save as the ball was destined for the far corner. It took Ipswich just one minute and seven seconds to break the deadlock after the restart.  Opener: Daryl Murphy heads home the opener for Ipswich  A patient build-up involving Luke Hyam and Cole Skuse got the ball out to Mings and his cross was headed home by Murphy. The play-off chasing hosts had the momentum and they caused more panic in the Doncaster defence when Tamas\' attempt to clear Murphy\'s cross was almost hacked into his own net. Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, one of two attacking subs by Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy at the interval, then shot wide after good closing down from Hyam. A largely uneventful second half seemed to be heading safely towards a home win when Doncaster received a lifeline out of nothing.  Level: Chris Brown scored a penalty for Rovers just seven minutes before the end  Mings was adjudged to have pushed substitute Mark Duffy just inside the box and Brown made no mistake from 12 yards with 82 minutes on the clock. But Ipswich restored their lead less than three minutes later when Williams\' shot was deflected to Chambers, who rattled the ball past Johnstone. A nervy home side were hanging on and Gerken had to save from Brown\'s close-range header and Duffy\'s low 20-yarder before Frank Nouble wasted a glorious chance to make it three.   More...

Published: 11:25 EST, 12 April 2014 | Updated: 11:38 EST, 12 April 2014 0 View comments  Barnsley\'s relegation fears worsened after Jermaine Beckford\'s first half goal saw them beaten 1-0 at Bolton in the Sky Bet Championship. The Tykes had a golden opportunity to take a point back to South Yorkshire, when Ryan McLaughlin won a penalty with just under 10 minutes left. But Chris O\'Grady\'s spot-kick smashed the frame of the goal to deny them a draw which on the balance of play they would have deserved.  First blood: Jermaine Beckford (R) rounds the keeper to put Bolton in the lead just before half-time All action: Bolton striker Jermaine Beckford (C) has another attempt on Barnsley\'s goal  Match factsBolton: Bogdan, Hutton, Baptiste, Spearing, Mills, Ream, Lee, Trotter, Beckford, Moritz, Hall.Subs: Knight, Danns, Lonergan, Mason, Jutkiewicz, Wheater, Kamara Barnsley: Steele, Etuhu, Kennedy, Dawson, Mvoto, Nyatanga, McLaughlin, Lawrence, O\'Grady, Cywka, JenningsSubs: Hassell, Cranie, Proschwitz, Hunt, Mellis, Turner, McCourtClick HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Championship Bolton\'s on-loan signing Joe Mason was named among the substitutes in what was the last game of his loan spell before returning to parent club Cardiff. Liam Lawrence returned for the visitors after missing their defeat by Burnley with a slight calf strain and Kelvin Etuhu came back from suspension. Barnsley looked threatening early on and should have taken the lead. Terrific interplay saw McLaughlin feed the ball into Dale Jennings, who somehow blazed it over the bar. Beckford then had a chance to open the scoring. Chung-Yong Lee cut the ball back inside from a cross, but the Jamaican international could not guide the pass to the target in a half that failed to capture the imagination. But, just as the game was approached the break, Wanderers scored a surprising goal. A long ball out of defence from Matt Mills caught the Barnsley defence napping, with Beckford controlling well and then rounding the ball past Luke Steele into an empty net. They then had the opportunity to double the lead early in the second half. Alan Hutton set-up Andre Moritz from close range, but Steele stood tall and chested the ball out for a corner.   More...

The Tykes had a chance to equalise when O\'Grady volleyed from the edge of the area, though the ball went straight into the hands of Adam Bogdan. A Rob Hall long ball puts Beckford into a similar situation from which he scored. However, this time he could not guide the ball home. Barnsley were now pushing for the draw with chances from Kennedy and Thomasz Cywka and they could have had a penalty when O\'Grady looked to be pushed in the back by Matt Mills.

Jennings then hit a shot from 25 yards which smashes against the post, though the referee awarded a corner. Their biggest chance came when McLaughlin won a penalty after being brought down in the box from a clumsy challenge from Alex Baptiste, who was then substituted shortly after.

The Addicks\' fourth defeat under head coach Jose Riga increased their relegation worries, while the Seagulls now boast 19 clean sheets - the most in the Sky Bet Championship.  Brighton, beaten in their previous two home games, had to make a change in goal with former Leeds player Casper Ankergren drafted in for his first league start in a year in place of Tomasz Kuszczak,who was forced to withdraw through illness.

Lingard, on loan from Manchester United, skipped past Michael Morrison to score with a cool low shot after good play from LuaLua had put pressure on the Charlton defence. Charlton were indebted to Hamer shortly after when the keeper dashed out positively to claim the ball at the feet of the on-rushing LuaLua. Skipper Gordon Greer came to Brighton\'s rescue with a well-timed challenge on Marvin Sordell on the edge of the area after March gave the ball away. Defender Stephen Ward over-hit a cross for the Seagulls, directed at striker Ulloa, when LuaLua had created space down the left with a surging run. Hamer was able to make a straightforward claim after March got the better of Lawrie Wilson, but his cross was disappointing. Charlton captain Johnnie Jackson displayed composure to clear under pressure from former England defender Matthew Upson, March having delivered a deep corner to the far post. The visitors almost snatched an equaliser when a shot from Reza Ghoochannejhad took a deflection off Greer and came back against the bar.  On the run: Charlton Athletic\'s Diego Poyet (left) and Brighton and Hove Albion\'s Jesse Lingard battle for the ball  Play switched to the other end and, a minute before the break, Ulloa pounced to hit his 15th goal of the season from close range latching onto a short pass from Lingard. Ankergren, seldom troubled in the first half, dived to deflect a dangerous cross from substitute Callum Harriott shortly after the interval, Harriott having been introduced in place of Astrit Ajdarevic. A 50-yard pass from Greer sent LuaLua away on goal for the Seagulls, but Hamer showed alertness to come out and save at the winger\'s feet. Hamer later denied Lingard by turning his goal-bound shot round the post, and Lingard should have done better moments later when he rounded Hamer only to put the ball wastefully over. Charlton, with Sordell up front on his own, threatened when a free-kick from Jackson was headed wide by Morrison with Greer covering him well. Substitute Jake Forster-Caskey put a free-kick into the side-netting for the Seagulls 10 minutes from time after Lingard was pulled down just outside the area. Forster-Caskey put the seal on Brighton\'s comfortable win in the fourth minute of added time by latching onto a pass from Ward and giving Hamer no chance with a low shot into the corner.   More...

manager after another setback in a calamitous first season in charge. Reports in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf have claimed an Old Trafford delegation met with Van Gaal earlier this week, in the wake of a Champions’ League defeat against Bayern Munich that ended Moyes’ hopes of having something to show for his debut campaign as United boss. United denied any such meeting took place, but it is clear Van Gaal is figuring prominently in their thoughts as they deliberate over Moyes’ future.

The signals coming out of Old Trafford had always been that Moyes would have every opportunity to stamp his mark on a new era and would be given until next Christmas, at least, to succeed. But such was the sense of dismay at a dismal performance in Athens that, even though the damage was repaired in the return leg, doubts crept in about his suitability and thoughts turned to who might replace him. Van Gaal admits holding Tottenham talks  Replacement: Van Gaal has also been linked with the Tottenham manager\'s position, that will become vacant when Tim Sherwood leaves in the summer   End of the road: Manchester United players look dejected after Bayern Munich knocked them out of the Champions League in midweek   Nightmare: Wayne Rooney reacts in dismay as Thomas Muller scores Bayern Munich\'s second goal in the second leg at the Allianz Arena  VAN GAAL\'S TROPHY CABINET AJAXEredivisie: 1993-1994, 1994-1995, 1995-1996KNVB Cup: 1992-1993Johan Cruyff Shield: 1993, 1994, 1995Champions League: 1994-1995UEFA Cup: 1991-1992UEFA Super Cup: 1995Intercontinental Cup: 1995BARCELONALa Liga: 1997-1998, 1998-1999Copa del Rey: 1997-1998UEFA Super Cup: 1997AZ ALKMAAREredivisie: 2008-2009BAYERN MUNICHBundesliga: 2009-2010DFB-Pokal: 2009-2010DFB-Supercup: 2010 Sportsmail understands United are adamant that, if a change is made, their next choice will be a proven name with a pedigree for winning honours at the highest level. It is also understood Van Gaal, 62, who steps down as Holland coach after this summer’s World Cup and becomes a free agent, has been made aware he is at the top of their list. He has a good relationship with United striker Robin van Persie after working together for the Holland team. Van Gaal has also been sounded out about succeeding Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane, where Tottenham bosses are becoming increasingly concerned about his reluctance to commit himself. Sources in Holland insist that is because he knows he is in the frame at United, should patience with Moyes run out. United may yet persevere with Moyes, and Van Gaal would then step in at Tottenham, but the former Barcelona boss would prefer Old Trafford as his next destination and will continue to monitor developments there. When asked about the discussions United dismissed any link with Van Gaal and said that meeting had taken place.  Reports: The story appeared in a left-hand column on the back page of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf on Saturday Van Gaal: Van Persie a big miss for United   Partnership: Van Gaal has worked extensively with Man United striker Robin van Persie during his tenure as Holland manager    Van Gaal agreed to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson when he announced his retirement in 2001, only to be thwarted when the Scot changed his mind a few months later. He wrote in his autobiography: \'It was before the World Cup of 2002, I was in contact with Manchester United through Peter Kenyon (then United chief executive). \'It was said to me that Alex Ferguson was going to retire. \'The moment he\'d go, I\'d succeed him.

Rangers twice threw away the lead, given to them by Yossi Benayoun - after just 65 seconds - and Junior Hoilett, when they gifted Jamaal Lascelles and Matt Derbyshire equalisers. But just as their inability to defend corners looked set to cost them, late goals from Nedum Onuoha, Ravel Morrison and Bobby Zamora secured a first win in four for the hosts.  Pumped: Nedum Onuoha thundered in QPR\'s third goal as they beat Nottingham Forest 5-2   Decent start! Midfielder Yossi Benayoun gave the hosts an early lead on Saturday afternoon  MATCH FACTSQPR: Green; Simpson, Dunne, Onuoha, Assou-Ekotto, Hoilett (Kranjcar 77), Jenas (Henry 13), Carroll, Benayoun, Morrison, Austin (Zamora 75)Goals: Benayoun 2, Hoilett, 43, Onuoha 84, Morrison 90, Zamora 90Nottingham Forest: Darlow, Halford, Lascelles, Wilson, Fox, Peltier, Jara (Greening 65), Mackie, Cox (Henderson 74), Lansbury (Osborn 65), DerbyshireGoals: Lascelles 37, Derbyshire 75Att: 17,220Referee: Oliver LangfordClick HERE for full results, fixtures and tables in the Championship They should now at least be assured of a top-six finish, which is more than can be said for Forest after a 12th game without a win. Incoming manager Stuart Pearce was in the Loftus Road stands to cast his eye over the team he will inherit in the summer, but he will have been less than impressed with their start to the match. Morrison and Hoilett combined to tee up Tom Carroll, whose shot from the edge of the area was palmed away by Karl Darlow. Unfortunately for the Forest keeper the ball bounced straight to the lurking Benayoun who nodded it into an empty net. Rangers\' chances of making it through the play-offs are likely to rest on leading scorer Charlie Austin\'s shoulders - as did their automatic promotion hopes until he dislocated one of them in January. On his first start since returning to fitness the striker should have been celebrating his 16th goal of the season but, lacking match sharpness, he failed to connect with Benoit Assou-Ekotto\'s inviting cross in front of goal.    Wanted it more: The former Chelsea star got ahead of left-back Danny Fox to nod in the opener at Loftus Road   Watching brief: Stuart Pearce was at the game to run the rule over Forest before taking charge in the summer   All smiles!

Doyle set for early return to QPR after fears Wolves striker would be out for the season Blackburn 2-0 QPR: Rovers leave Rangers\' hopes of automatic promotion in tatters Pearson calls for focused minds as Foxes chase Championship title after promotion And Rangers, never ones to make life easy for themselves, gave away a sloppy corner in the 37th minute and then left defender Lascelles all alone at the near post to head in Henri Lansbury\'s cross.Forest were only level for five minutes, however, before a slick move involving Benayoun and Carroll ended with Hoilett dinking the ball over Darlow to put Rangers back into the lead.But in the 73rd minute Forest were level again, and Rangers could not say they had not been warned as from another corner, Derbyshire was allowed too much room to power home his header.The match by now could have gone either way but it swung back towards Rangers when Onuoha\'s persistence in keeping the ball in play was rewarded when he tucked in Carroll\'s reverse pass.Then in stoppage time Rangers put a heavy gloss on the scoreline, Morrison slotting past Darlow before teeing up substitute Zamora for the fifth.

Forest ower Fawaz Al Hasawi was in the stands, but his side face a struggle to make the play-offs   Pulling the strings: On-loan Ravel Morrison impressed again in the Rangers midfield Redknapp: It\'s time for Ravel to show what he can do   Remember: Both sets of players observed a minute\'s silence in honour of the 96 Hillsborough victims   Drifts on by: Hoilett was put clean through but couldn\'t force a way past Darlow in goal Redknapp: Engage your brain before opening your mouth    More...

defeat on Saturday. The former Leeds United and Liverpool winger, who was a part of the Champions League winning side in Istanbul in 2005, has brought the curtain down on his 18-year career in football. Appropriately, after an injury-ravaged career, the 35-year-old Socceroos legend was only survived a late fitness test after just recovering from a rib injury.

He was part of the Leeds youth-team that claimed the 1996–97 FA Youth Cup final, and then made his name as part of the young and impressive side that featured the likes of Jonathan Woodgate, Mark Viduka and Alan Smith. Kewell decided to bring an end to his career in the match on Saturday because the opponenets, Western Sydney Wanderers, are from the suburbs where he was raised. And the Wanderers came from behind to beat Melbourne Heart 3-2 at AAMI Park, denying Kewell a winning send-off. Goals from Nikolai Topor-Stanley, Brendan Santalab and Youssouf Hersi sealed the victory for the away team.

Rather than snap back at Bradley’s prediction that he is about to finish the boxing career of the Philippines congressman, Pacquiao says:  ‘I don’t care about him disrespecting me. I pray for him.’ That said, by a devout Roman Catholic, there are consolations for Pacquiao in the controversy which has obliged them to do it all over again. Millions of them. Pacquiao is guaranteed a minimum of $20 million for a Saturday night’s work in the MGM Grand Garden Arena lasting a maximum of 36 minutes. How richly he deserves that reward is best explained by another statistic. This is the occasion on which Pacquiao will become only the second boxer to exceed $700 million in terms of pay-per-viewTV revenue generated in their careers The other is Floyd Mayweather and if ever these two do get into a ring together they would burst through the one billion barrier. Manny Pacquiao: I am so motivated for Timothy Bradley fight Rolling in it: Pacquiao is guaranteed a minimum of $20 million for a Saturday night¿s work Confidence: Pacquiao of the Philippines poses with undefeated WBO welterweight champion Bradley Leaving the rest in the shade: Manny Pacquiao is a fusion of supreme fighter and politician  For the moment, Pacquiao is content to leap-frog over Oscar De La Hoya into the 700 club. He goes back in against Bradley on $661 million, while Mayweather will add to his $756 million tally when he fights Marcos Maidana next month. HBO network executives are expecting Pacquiao-Bradley 11 to comfortably surpass one million buys. But even a repeat of the 890,000 who subscribed for the first fight will carry the PacMan above that $700 million mark. The big one: Manny Pacquiao faces Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas on Saturday night Answer to their prayers: The fans\' favourite acknowledges the supporters in Las Vegas Those numbers are all the more remarkable since Pacquiao is the only non-American in a top five, in which Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson place fourth and fifth behind De La Hoya. They are a testament in part to his charm, modesty and generosity of spirit but mostly to the high-octane excitement he brings to the ring and which he is promising to rev back up to full power here on the Las Vegas Strip Pacquiao has not landed a knock-out since 2009, the year in which that dynamite left hook flattened Ricky Hatton and stopped Miguel Cotto. Bradley, having benefited from the skewed judging against Pacquiao and then seen him brutally knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez, believes this distinguished challenger for his world welterweight title has lost his killer instinct. But while there have been signs of Pacquiao showing compassion in the later round to opponents he is beating comfortably, he insists there will be no let up from now on. Manny Pacquiao arrives in Vegas ahead of Timothy Bradley bout May the best man win: Pacquiao and Bradley were respectful at their pre-fight press conference He says: ‘Tim will find out that my intensity is there. I will be throwing punches non-stop. Not least because I want to excite the fans and make them happy. I don’t know if the opportunity will come to knock him out but if it does I will take it. ‘I won’t get careless like I did when I was about to stop Marquez but I will take the moment if it comes. I know this is an important fight in my career and I am very positive about everything.’ Pacquiao acknowledges that Bradley has improved since their first meeting, coming through a war against Ruslan Provodnikov and then impressively out-pointing Marquez. The Californian has won all his 31 fights thus far, courtesy in part of that scandalous decision against Pacquiao. He, too, suffered from that miss-judging, even though he was convinced he had won that fight despite suffering from sore feet. He was abused by many of the public, received death threats and became so depressed that at one point he contemplated suicide. Grudge match: Bradley celebrates with the welterweight belt after beating the Filipino almost two years ago Psychologically he has re-grouped with the help of his wife Monica, who is also his manager. And at 27 he is foretelling the end of the ring’s only eight-division world champion, who is eight years his elder. To which Pacquiao says: ‘I’m 35 years young.’ That means that he is ready to chase down – for the full 12 rounds if necessary – an opponent who, although graduated to world class now,  he expects to try to hit and run. Were he to fail in that pursuit it is conceivable that boxing would lose a star attraction and one of its two biggest money generators. But if he shines against Bradley, as he did against another young gun Brandon Rios in November, we might yet see that super-fight with Mayweather. Undefeated: But Floyd Mayweather plans to retire next season Doubts: Pacquiao\'s trainer Freddie Roach Pacquiao does not go in for boastful predictions but he does say:  ‘Rios also said he was going to retire me.  But they have to prove it in the ring and I know everything that is necessary against Bradley. ‘My journey will continue beyond Saturday night.’ Since he assures he has got his KO mojo working again, believe him. Expect the PacMan, whose wife Jinkee expects their fifth child imminently, either to deliver a late stoppage or receive a unanimous decision from a new set of judges in whom, he says, he trusts completely.

All matches in England will kick-off seven minutes late and be preceded by a minutes\' silence to remember those lost while cheering on their team at the FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest on April 15, 1989. But few tributes this weekend will be as spine-tinglingly emotional as the rendition of Liverpool\'s club anthem \'You\'ll Never Walk Alone\' during the European Cup semi-final between AC Milan and Real Madrid just four days after the tragedy.

The two teams stopped where they were on the pitch and bowed their heads as the 73,000 San Siro crowd broke out into spontaneous applause. Milan supporters\' groups had distributed leaflets with the words of the song printed on them in the days leading up to the match and urged their fans to learn them off by heart. The result was a remarkable rendition from all sides of the ground that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. It was a brilliant night for Milan, whose team included such legends as Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Carlo Ancelotti. They crushed Real 5-0, thanks to goals from Ancelotti, Rijkaard, Gullit, van Basten and Roberto Donadoni, and went on to lift the trophy by beating Steaua Bucharest 4-0 in the final.

Say the word to those of a certain age on Merseyside and almost all will be able to tell you where they were, and what they were doing, on April 15, 1989. I was at Villa Park on what turned out to be the darkest day in English football’s history. Everton were playing Norwich in the FA Cup semi-final, Pat Nevin scored the winning goal and it should have been one of the great days of my young life. Instead it was anything but. I remember an announcement being made at half-time to say the other semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest had been abandoned but as these were the days before mobile phones and social media nobody knew why.

We travelled back from Birmingham in near silence, worrying about my cousin, Jamie, and all the other Liverpool fans who we knew had gone to Hillsborough. Only when we got back did we hear the full extent. I was only 11 then and my final memory of the day was when the BBC announced Match of the Day had been cancelled out of respect to those who had died. Everyone we knew, thankfully, came home. For the families of the 96, however, the nightmare was just beginning and it is a national disgrace that they were made to  suffer for so long. Those families have fought tirelessly for justice over the past 25 years and at Anfield tomorrow, before Liverpool’s showdown with Manchester City, then again on Tuesday, when the annual Memorial Service is staged, we will pay tribute to the ones who so tragically passed away. Across Stanley Park, Everton will do the same, as pictures of the service will be beamed on to a big screen at Goodison Park; Everton have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Liverpool over Hillsborough, which is why  you should never class it as a one-football-club tragedy. It wasn’t. It affected the whole city, as Evertonians had family, friends and work colleagues at Hillsborough. The rivalry between the clubs is intense but, for this particular matter, the bond is unbreakable. When I started attending the Memorial Service as a Liverpool player in 1996, I understood what had happened, but it was only after I became a father in 2002 that I really got a sense of perspective on the agony those parents who lost sons and daughters must have endured. At times during those services, when I heard the congregation singing for ‘justice’, I lost hope that they would ever get a resolution but their resolve, courage and determination to keep fighting has been inspirational, not just to everyone at the club but around the city and far beyond.  Leader: Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish sees the horror of the Hillsborough disaster first hand   Memorial: Scarves, shirts and the plaque at the Shankly Gates at Anfield marking the 20th anniversary in 2009   Unbreakable bond: An Everton and Liverpool fan stand together on Goodison Park in tribute to the 96 in 2012    The families of the 96 got their  breakthrough in 2009, at the 20th Anniversary Memorial Service. Andy Burnham, who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, addressed the crowd but he was shouted down. Afterwards, I attended a reception at Liverpool Town Hall with Steven Gerrard and Kenny Dalglish as the families were being honoured with the Freedom of the City; Burnham was visibly shaken by what had happened and he said that night: ‘We will get to the bottom of this.’ Hopefully, now that the fresh inquests into the deaths have started, some form of closure will arrive at some point in the near future, but that does not mean what happened that day in Sheffield can ever be forgotten.  Liverpool Ambassador: Club legend Dalglish went to all 96 funerals and even attended four in one day   Respect: The clock at Hillsborough is stopped at 15.06, the time the game was stopped (left), while Sheffield Wednesday have paid tribute on the cover of the match programme for Saturday\'s game with Blackburn (right) Never forget: Liverpool fans show their respect to the people who died before a home game at Anfield Speech: Andy Burham insisted \'we will get to the bottom of this\' after speaking at the 2009 memorial service  Up and down the country this weekend, young children will be going to games and asking their  parents why all matches are kicking off seven minutes later than they are normally scheduled, after a period of silence. It is important they, and future generations, understand what happened. No stadium will carry the feeling like Anfield; Liverpool’s players will have to use the emotion to their advantage and not let it affect them the way it happened to Manchester United when they marked the 50th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster against Manchester City. Anfield is unique when it comes to generating atmosphere on special occasions. As a player, you try to block the noise out when the game begins but you are always conscious of the impact it can have and tomorrow could be a day to rival St Etienne in 1977 or Chelsea in 2005. I played in the latter game, the Champions League semi-final, and it was the most intense atmosphere I experienced. When Liverpool’s fans build up a head of steam, they can influence the result of a game and that certainly happened against Chelsea nine years ago. Super sub: David Fairclough scores for Liverpool against St Etienne in the 1977 European Cup quarter-final Famous night: Liverpool frontman Luis Garcia (second right) celebrates after scoring against Chelsea in 2005     Team effort: Carragher punches the air and celebrates with goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek after beating Chelsea  There is a month of the campaign to go but it feels like the title decider. A draw would let Chelsea back in, assuming they beat Swansea, but the way Liverpool and City are playing, there should be goals. Liverpool need three points. City, with a game in hand, would be the happier if it is a stalemate. Incidentally, the last time Liverpool were involved in a title race, in 2009, it came in the year of a significant Hillsborough anniversary. We finished second that season, despite our best efforts. It would be fitting, then, if Brendan Rodgers and his squad could go one step better this time.  Runners-up: Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring against Man United when Liverpool finished second in 2009    TOP FIVE... YOUNG PLAYERS OF THE YEAR Luis Suarez is odds-on to win PFA Player of the Year but less clear-cut is who will receive the Young Player’s award. Eden Hazard and Daniel Sturridge are the favourites but these five young stars also deserve to be high up in people’s thinking.  Clear favourite: Liverpool frontman Luis Suarez is odds-on to win the PFA Player of the Year award   Boy in Blue: Chelsea wideman Eden Hazard has been one of the standout performers for the Blues this season   Natural goalscorer: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has been lethal in front of the goal for the Reds     1. Raheem Sterling There was always a buzz around Raheem when I was at Liverpool but this season he has shown there is substance to the hype. He has been brilliant since getting back into the team, adding goals to his speed on the flanks, and he looks set to go to the World Cup.  Living up to the hype: Liverpool frontman Raheem Sterling has added goals to his game this season     2. Ross Barkley Back in August, when I wrote my second column for Sportsmail, I highlighted the Everton midfielder as one to watch and he has done nothing but improve. An explosive talent, with energy and two great feet, he is another who Roy Hodgson will come calling for in June.  One to watch: Ross Barkley has constantly improved this season as Everton challenge for fourth     3. Luke Shaw Scouts have been flocking to St Mary’s to see Shaw in action and it is no wonder the top clubs want to prise the left back away from Southampton. If he moves this summer, Shaw will command a huge fee but it will be warranted as he has consistently impressed.  Top talent: Southampton\'s Luke Shaw has attracted attention from a host of rival Premier League clubs      4. Adnan Januzaj Manchester United have endured a disappointing campaign but the one bright spot has been the emergence of Januzaj. He’s played 32 games, which is a lot for a 19-year-old, but he has a big future. I liked what I saw of him in pre-season and he has built on that impression.  Bright spot: Adnan Januzaj has shined in an otherwise disappointing campaign for Manchester United     5. John Stones Roberto Martinez is not afraid to give young players opportunities if they are good enough and Stones has impressed since being given his Everton chance. I like the way he uses the ball and it was interesting to see he completed 39 of the 40 passes he attempted against Arsenal last week.  Taking his chances: Everton defender John Stones (left) is equally adept at passing as he his tackling     Hull manager Steve Bruce deserves more credit There has been a lot of talk about who should be crowned Manager of the Year and the vote seems to be split between Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez. Tony Pulis, of course, is also in the running thanks to the outstanding job he has done with Crystal Palace, but why has there not been more made of Steve Bruce’s work at Hull? hen Hull came up last season, many would have had them in their three picks for relegation but it looks like they are going to stay in the Barclays Premier League quite comfortably and they could even crown the campaign with success in the FA Cup.  Under the radar: Steve Bruce has guided Hull to mid-table and could crown the season with Cup success    Bruce, who wants his teams to play in the right style and spirit, deserves to lead Hull out against Sheffield United at Wembley tomorrow and I doubt anyone would begrudge him if he returned next month and climbed the 107 steps to get the trophy, 20 years after he did so as Manchester United’s captain. It used to be said he would be a contender to take over the reins from Sir Alex Ferguson one day but there is a chance an even bigger job might come on his radar in the future, particularly if he puts silverware on his CV. Should the FA keep with their current mantra of wanting an Englishman to manage the England team, I’m sure Bruce would come into their thoughts. He turned down the chance to win an England cap when he was in his 30s but there is little chance he would turn down the FA a second time.  Captain fantastic: Bruce (left) holds aloft the FA Cup in 1994 following Man United\'s final win over Chelsea      Dalglish: We laugh at same stories every time we\'re back together Whelan: I will drive Kenny home to make sure he starts me Evans: It\'s nice to have a Premier League which is competitive   More...

the big games, including heat maps All good things come to an end. For Roberto Martinez and Everton, that finale could come all too abruptly. As the Toffees continue their assault on Champions League qualification, many - particularly those in north London - have questioned the morals of three key players being loaned in from top clubs. Gareth Barry has been the lynchpin in allowing Martinez\'s free-flowing midfield, Gerard Deulofeu has shown off his exquisite talent in spells and Romelu Lukaku has spent all season proving to everyone that Chelsea do, in fact, have a top-class striker.  Deadly duo: Gareth Barry (left) and Romelu Lukaku have had a terrific season on loan at Everton The truth is that Everton have worked a flawed system flawlessly. It is an undesirable state of affairs that Lukaku can hurt Chelsea\'s rivals when not even based in west London. Even better for Lukaku, who gets first-team football away from Stamford Bridge and the pressure of being second fiddle. Everton get a Champions League quality player. But if Martinez\'s men do break into the top four, it is hard to see them carrying on that momentum shorn of those three players.  Back of the net: Lukaku wheels away having notches Everton\'s second goal in their 3-0 win over Arsenal last Sunday Christian Benteke\'s injury means Lukaku will be 100 per cent leading the line for Belgium at the World Cup. If it\'s true that Jose Mourinho doesn\'t see him as part of his first-team plans for Chelsea, the World Cup will be the ultimate shop window, where Lukaku\'s value rockets to the kind of £30million fees a level above where Everton are able to play. Everton with LukakuPlayed 25 - Won 16 - Drawn 6 - Lost 3Goals per game: 1.9Win percentage: 64%Points per game: 2.2Everton without LukakuPlayed 7 - Won 3 - Drawn 3 - Lost 2Goals per game: 0.7Win percentage: 29%Points per game: 1.3 This would mean a major revamp of Everton\'s attack. The Toffees have won just 1.3 points per game without the Belgian as opposed to 2.2 with him in the side. Naturally, the Toffees’ potency is also greatly reduced, with them relying on Steven Naismith or Kevin Mirallas for goals. With Lukaku, Everton manage 1.9 goals per game, and just 0.7 without him. His 76 shots are the most of any Everton player, with him and Mirallas far and away the most forward-thinking Toffees. Losing this without replacement would be catastrophic.

Gareth Barry has used the temporary switch to reinvigorate a career on its last legs to become one of the league\'s vital midfielders. It\'s impossible to overstate what Barry gives the team.

They also concede over a goal a game without the former England man as opposed to 0.9 with him in the side. He is central to everything Everton do. Barry has the most touches on the ball in a game than any other player in the side, and his number of passes over a game comes in only behind Yaya Toure and David Silva, central stars for high-flying Manchester City.  Driving force: Barry plays a pivotal role in building Toffee attacks from his deep-lying midfield position    Touches per game: EvertonBarry: 83.4Baines: 82.8Jagielka: 69.8Coleman: 65.4McCarthy: 64.5 Passes per game: Premier LeagueYaya Toure: 70.7David Silva: 70.5Gareth Barry: 67.4Michael Carrick: 66.9Aaron Ramsey: 66.9 His heat map in last weekend’s 3-0 destruction of Arsenal shows what he offers the team. He completely controlled the crucial area just inside Everton’s half, allowing the rest of the midfield to kill off the lacklustre Gunners.  Influence: Gareth Barry\'s heatmap against Arsenal demonstrates just how much influence he has for Everton  It’s no overstatement to say that Barry has been one of the best midfielders in the league this season. To replace what he gives Everton usually costs an absolute premium. Midfielders who can enjoy that level of control over possession in a Premier League game are a valuable commodity. Good news then, that Barry seems the most likely out of any of the loan charges to pen a permanent deal at Goodison Park in the summer. Even so, his aging years mean he\'s still not a long-term solution. Someone who would be is Gerard Deulofeu. One of the major talking points in England in the fallout of Barcelona\'s proposed transfer ban is that the playmaker will now stay with the Catalan giants. While it was previously thought he may have been a slight level below what Barcelona need – not that that stops you being a superb player for 99 per cent of teams – they will now be looking to Deulofeu for fresh blood.  On target: Another loanee Gerard Deulofeu has also shown his class at times this season for Everton  Deulofeu has played only in fits and starts while he get to grips with the experience of playing in an honours-chasing side, and has also been overshadowed by the emergence of Ross Barkley, but his class has been clear. It’s another bright young talent that won’t be plying his trade at Goodison Park. The problem with this route to the top is you generally only get to do it once. Manchester City, Chelsea and Barcelona might not be as open to lending top talent to a fellow Champions League club. While Roberto Martinez has performed miracles this season, his greatest trick will come this summer when he has to Sellotape his side back together over the chasms that Lukaku and Barry will leave. Do that and carry on from where they left off, and even Arsene Wenger won’t have anything to moan about.  Mastermind: Roberto Martinez will need to perform more miracles next season without Barry and Lukaku    More...

Captain fantastic: Swansea City boss Gary Monk wants skipper Ashley Williams to prolong his stay in Wales   No nonsense: Defender Williams (left) just has over a year left on his contract at the Liberty Stadium  \'What he does for the club, I would have him here for as long as possible,\' Swansea head coach Monk said. \'He has been linked with clubs for a few years - it is what happens with good players. He\'s an important player that, as a club, we should keep as long as possible. \'He is a good guy who cares for the club and wants the best for us. I know he is happy here and I don\'t see a problem. \'I haven\'t had a conversation about his future. I speak to him frequently, but it\'s about the football, things we can improve and the defensive side of things, giving him things what he can take on to the pitch to influence the rest of the guys.\'  All smiles: Napoli, managed by former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez, have been linked with a move for Williams  Williams will be an integral part of Swansea\'s plan to beat title-chasing Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday, when a win for Monk\'s men would effectively erase any lingering relegation fears. The game comes just five days after Chelsea booked a Champions League semi-final place by knocking out Paris St Germain, and Monk is fully aware of the challenge that awaits.  \'I don\'t buy we could catch them cold after midweek,\' he added. \'The players they have through the squad are top-class players. I am sure they will make changes, but whoever comes in is top-class. \'They are not pushing for the title for no reason. They have experience and class all over the pitch. It\'s an extremely tough game, but a challenge we are looking forward to and have to relish.  Vital: Monk has described Williams as an \'important player\' for Swansea and wants him to stay for many years  \'The journey this club (Swansea) has been on and fighting for is to be on this level, to compete against these sort of teams, and we have to make sure we continue that.\' Swansea will go into the Chelsea clash following a 1-0 defeat Hull last weekend, which came as a jolt, given that Monk had seen his team draw with Arsenal and beat Norwich in their previous two games. Swansea are currently six points above the relegation zone. After Chelsea, their remaining fixtures are against Newcastle, Aston Villa, Southampton and Sunderland.  History: As captain, Williams (centre) led Swansea to the Capital One Cup trophy last season  \'I was very annoyed with the (Hull) performance. The training was very good, the sessions very competitive,\' Monk said. \'As a manager all you can do is get it to that level and understand fully what is expected that they do it on a Saturday. That\'s the disappointment - the work they put in and we end up with a performance like that. \'If you had to say mathematically, we need two more wins. I want it, and we\'re aware of it. But we want more, we want consistency. We have been too inconsistent this season.  Moving on: Monk wants his side to bounce back against Chelsea after losing 1-0 at Hull last weekend  \'It is not as if it is small inconsistencies. We have performed brilliantly, then against Hull we were very, very poor. \'It is too big a gap. The best teams stay at a level, and that is what I want for the rest of the season.\'  Share or comment on this article 7shares','\n<p class=\"author-section\">By <a class=\"author\" href=\"/home/search.html?s=&amp;authornamef=John+Drayton\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Drayton</a> </p>\n<p class=\"byline-section\"><span class=\"article-timestamp article-timestamp-published\"> <span class=\"article-timestamp-label\">Published:</span> 07:57 EST, 12 April 2014 </span> | <span class=\"article-timestamp article-timestamp-updated\"> <span class=\"article-timestamp-label\">Updated:</span> 07:57 EST, 12 April 2014 </span> </p>\n<div id=\"articleIconLinksContainer\"> <ul> <li class=\"share-facebook\" onclick=\"postToFB(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-twitter\" onclick=\"postToTWTTR(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-pinterest\" onclick=\"postToPinterest(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-gplus\"> <span class=\"g-interactivepost\" data-calltoactionlabel=\"VIEW\" data-calltoactionurl=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2603148/Gary-Monk-wants-Swansea-City-skipper-Ashley-Williams-prolong-stay-amidst-Napoli-interest.html\" data-clientid=\"746589970956-e10ciaf67a1id9ggu75ph3ds0sthn7j6.apps.googleusercontent.com\" data-contentdeeplinkid=\"/pages\" data-contenturl=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2603148/Gary-Monk-wants-Swansea-City-skipper-Ashley-Williams-prolong-stay-amidst-Napoli-interest.html\" data-cookiepolicy=\"single_host_origin\" data-prefilltext=\"Monk wants Swansea skipper Williams to prolong stay amidst Napoli interest\"> <a onclick=\'postToGPlus(\"top\"); return false;\'></a> </span> </li> <li class=\"share-icons\" id=\"shareLinkTop\"> <a class=\"js-sl share-link\" href=\"#socialLinks\"> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=\"share-count\"> <b> 7</b> <span>shares</span> </div> <a class=\"comments-count home\" href=\"/sport/football/article-2603148/Gary-Monk-wants-Swansea-City-skipper-Ashley-Williams-prolong-stay-amidst-Napoli-interest.html#comments\"> <span></span> <p class=\"count-number\">0</p> <p class=\"count-text\">View <br/> comments</p> </a> </div>\n<br/>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Garry Monk wants Swansea and Wales captain Ashley Williams to remain with the Barclays Premier League club \'for as long as possible.\'</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Williams, 29, has just over a year left on his existing Swansea contract and Italian heavyweights Napoli - the Swans\' Europa League conquerors this season - are among those thought to be tracking him.</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Captain fantastic: Swansea City boss Gary Monk wants skipper Ashley Williams to prolong his stay in Wales\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"454\" id=\"i-5d090d3d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1A4BD27700000578-787_634x454.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Captain fantastic: Swansea City boss Gary Monk wants skipper Ashley Williams to prolong his stay in Wales</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"No nonsense: Defender Williams (left) just has over a year left on his contract at the Liberty Stadium\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"415\" id=\"i-aa670e74\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603148-1BC3B7D200000578-561_634x415.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">No nonsense: Defender Williams (left) just has over a year left on his contract at the Liberty Stadium</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\'What he does for the club, I would have him here for as long as possible,\' Swansea head coach Monk said.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\'He has been linked with clubs for a few years - it is what happens with good players.

The 24-year-old looked to be in contention for his first green jacket after carding an opening round of one under par 71.  Lone ranger: Rory McIlroy will play the third round of the Masters on his own after just making the cut on Friday McIlroy\'s funny gaffe suggesting Ian Woosnam can\'t win Masters Day to forget: McIlroy had a disappointing second round of 77 at Augusta National on Friday   MASTERS THIRD ROUND TEE TIMES1515 Rory McIlroy (NIrl)1525 Jason Day (Aus), Joost Luiten (Ned)1535 Jose Maria Olazabal (Spa), Darren Clarke (NIrl)1545 Miguel Angel Jimenez (Spa), Sandy Lyle (Sco)1555 Billy Horschel (USA), Gary Woodland (USA)1605 Chris Kirk (USA), Martin Kaymer (Ger)1615 Oliver Goss (Aus - amateur), Francesco Molinari (Ita)1625 Nick Watney (USA), Thongchai Jaidee (Tha)1635 Bill Haas (USA), Thorbjorn Olesen (Den)1655 Ian Poulter (Eng), Rickie Fowler (USA)1705 Steven Bowditch (Aus), Brendon de Jonge (Zim)1715 Hunter Mahan (USA), Justin Rose (Eng)1725 Vijay Singh (Fij), Bernhard Langer (Ger) MASTERS THIRD ROUND TEE TIMES1735 Steve Stricker (USA), Larry Mize (USA)1745 Mike Weir (Can), KJ Choi (Kor)1755 Henrik Stenson (Swe), Stewart Cink (USA)1805 Lee Westwood (Eng), Brandt Snedeker (USA)1815 Louis Oosthuizen (Rsa), Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano (Spa)1835 Lucas Glover (USA), Matt Kuchar (USA)1845 Kevin Stadler (USA), Jamie Donaldson (Wal)1855 Stephen Gallacher (Sco), Russell Henley (USA)1905 Jim Furyk (USA), Kevin Streelman (USA)1915 Fred Couples (USA), Jimmy Walker (USA)1925 Adam Scott (Aus), Jordan Spieth (USA)1935 Thomas Bjorn (Den), Jonas Blixt (Swe)1945 Bubba Watson (USA), John Senden (Aus) However, the world number nine had a day to forget on Friday as he made the weekend\'s play with his final shot. The Northern Ireland golfer did not realise he had to par the last to make the halfway cut on the mark of four over par, but held his nerve from four feet to complete a disappointing - and admittedly unfortunate - 77.  That meant a total of 51 players - 50 professionals and Australian amateur Oliver Goss - qualified for the last two rounds and ensured McIlroy would be the first man out at 1515, most likely playing with club member Jeff Knox as his marker.   More... It\'s hullabaloo for Bubba as masterful Watson in mood while Thomas looks Bjorn again too Daly is still a big draw at Hooters... Garcia and Watson are pretty in pink McIlroy scrapes through while Gallacher continues early Masters magic Scotsman Gallacher delighted to make cut on Masters debut... but is staying grounded Bjorn puts in masterful performance having barely been an afterthought before Augusta He\'s the real McCoy but angry Augusta eats up 17-over-par Mike \'I just want to go out there and try to get off to a fast start,\' said McIlroy, who visited some seldom-seen parts of the course on the 10th and 13th, the latter after his ball hit a sprinkler and bounded into the azaleas which give the hole its name. \'Eleven shots back (of leader Bubba Watson) with two rounds to play is going to be nearly impossible to make up so I\'m trying to shoot two really low rounds and see where that puts me at the end of the week. \'It will take something phenomenal to shoot something in the mid-60s and get myself back under par going into the last day. But I\'m going to need to be two, three or four under par going into the last day to have any sort of chance.\'  Winners and losers: 2012 champion Bubba Watson (left) is the overnight leader, while three-time champion Phil Mickelson (right) failed to make the weekend cut at Augusta National for the first time in 17 years  McIlroy at least had an outside chance to cling onto, which is more than could be said for three-time winner Phil Mickelson, who missed the cut by a shot to make an early exit for the first time since 1997. \'I just had one bad hole there at 12,\' said Mickelson, who found a greenside bunker on the 155-yard par three, thinned his second shot into another bunker and then did exactly the same again. \'I keep making these triple bogeys, they\'re tough to overcome. I\'ve actually played reasonably well for a majority of the holes and then the ones that I let slide I end up making a big number.\'  Early exit: South African duo Charl Schwartzel (left) and Ernie Els (right) both failed to make the weekend cut  Asked if he would watch the final two rounds on television, Mickelson added: \'It\'s an exciting tournament, so I probably will. It will kind of be my punishment.\' Luke Donald, Sergio Garcia, Ernie Els and 2011 champion Charl Schwartzel also missed out by a shot, Donald shooting a second round of 70 but paying the price for an opening 79 which included a two-shot penalty for touching the sand in a bunker on the ninth after failing to escape at the first attempt.

A win against Almeria would put Carlo Ancelotti\'s men level on points with their city rivals Atletico, who led the way in Spain coming into the weekend. Real Madrid will also have one eye on their Copa del Rey final against Barcelona at the Mestalla on Wednesday.  Tom Sheen Host commentator Auto-update 22:48 FULL TIME: Real Madrid 4-0 Almeria Real Madrid move into second place in La Liga. They are now level on points with their cross town rivals - and have a superior goal difference - but are second due to the head-to-head record. Diego Simeone\'s men play Getafe tomorrow night. 22:45 89mins Real Madrid fans starting to file out of the Bernabeu. Isco should have sent them on their way with a goal there as well. Benzema turned and found the former Malaga man in the box but he gets his shot all wrong and it dribbles straight into Esteban\'s arms. 22:40 85mins: GOAL! REAL MADRID 4-0 Almeria Lovely pass and a lovely finish to put the icing on Real Madrid\'s cake. Illarramendi lofts a pass to Morata - half of the Almeria defence tries to play offside, the other doesn\'t - and Morata lets the ball bounce once before stroking the ball into the roof of the net, neat finish. Finishing touch: Alvaro Morata makes it 4-0 to Real Madrid with a smart finish 22:38 81mins Terrible miss from Benzema, he\'s had some really good chances tonight. Modric\'s free-kick hits the wall, it falls to Morata who cleverly back-heels to Benzema. Rather than the cool and calm finish we are used to seeing from him, he snatches at it, hitting the ball as hard as he can. It, of course, flies over the top. 22:35 78mins Real Madrid are claiming for a penalty, but I think that would have been harsh had it been given. Isco scoops a clever ball over the top to Morata and the defender doesn\'t get too much of the ball but the substitute definitely tries to make the most of the contact, going down rather too easily. 22:31 75mins Another good chance for Benzema. Morata is set off down the left, he cuts back inside ad curls a ball into the striker, who takes it first time but drags the volley just wide. 22:29 73mins: Real Mdrid sub Fabio Coentrao is replaced by another youngster Diego Llorente. 22:25 70mins: Real Madrid sub Gareth Bale is replaced by Real youngster Alvaro Morata. 22:25 68mins Sustained pressure from Real Madrid and a couple of close calls but they can\'t quite turn the ball into the net. Coentrao fires across the box and then it comes the other way from Isco. 22:21 65mins Diego Lopez is finally called into action and makes a really good save. From the free-kick the big goalkeeper gets down to his left smartly. Game over: Isco adds Real Madrid\'s third and ends the contest 22:20 64mins: Real Madrid sub Angel di Maria is replaced by Casemiro. Excellent performance from the Argentine. 22:16 60mins Esteban goes some way to making up for that earlier miss, with a good save from marauding left back Fabio Coentrao. The overlapping full back had options but decides to shoot through the goalkeeper\'s legs, Esteban gets just enough on it to keep him out. 22:11 56mins: GOAL! REAL MADRID 3-0 Almeria It really is game over now and maybe Esteban should do better with that strike. A cross from right to left finds Isco and the right back Nelson allows him to turn. His near post shot should have been saved. It definitely is game over now - Almeria take off their top goalscorer Rodri for a midfielder. 22:11 From Sportsmail\'s Pete Jenson at the Bernabeu Seven of Bale\'s 14 league goals have come with Cristiano Ronaldo not in the side. He\'s stepped up every time he\'s been needed to fill in for Real\'s top scorer 22:08 52mins: GOAL! REAL MADRID 2-0 Almeria Beautifully worked team goal and Angel Di Maria is at the heart of it again. He drivers forwards and plays a give and go with Benzema. The winger gives it again to the Frenchman who shifts the ball one more to find Gareth Bale. His shot is at Esteban but it\'s too hot for the goalkeeper to handle and it looks like game over. Doubled: Gareth Bale celebrates after making it 2-0 to Real Madird 22:07 51mins From a Real corner it\'s half cleared and falls to Modric on the edge, but his shot is well hit but always bending away from goal. 22:06 49mins Another corner for Almeria but again the delivery is poor. The last two have gone straight into Diego Lopez\'s hands. They balls in have to be better if Almeria want a chance of coming back. 22:03 47mins Fantastic dummy from Isco to get some space for the shot, though it\'s blocked and goes behind for a corner. Nothing comes from that. 22:02 46mins Ominous statistic for Almeria - Real have won all 18 previous games in which they\'ve been ahead at half-time this season. 22:01 SECOND HALF We\'re back at the Bernabeu, Almeria start with the ball. 21:46 HALF TIME: Real Madrid 1-0 Almeria Opener: Angel Di Maria scores the first goal of the game with a curling strike 21:46 45mins Pepe wins a header and the ball lands at Benzema\'s feet. He strikes from outside the box but drags the shot wide of the left post. 21:42 41mins To put Almeria\'s struggles into a nice stat, their top passer has completed just six of his 16 passes... Luka Modric has almost 40 successful passes. 21:40 41mins Bale goes close this time - on the right hand side he cuts inside, gives the defender a step over and strikes towards the near post. It flashes wide. 21:39 38mins An outrageous attempt from Angel Di Maria almost catches Esteban off guard! From a corner Di Maria spots the keeper off his line - he attempts a direct shot and it takes a flying save to keep the ball out. Really unlucky from the Argentine who has been the best player in this first half. 21:37 37mins Almeria are offering nothing going forward. They work hard to get the ball back but as soon as they have it they give it away again. 21:36 35mins Well, Gareth Bale scored plenty of free-kicks from that kind of range last season, but that was poor. He steps up, tries to get the ball up and down but the ball just keeps going up and up and up. 21:33 From Sportsmail\'s Pete Jenson at the Bernabeu The Almeria substitute Silva is their fourth choice centre-back. He\'s played just one game all season. It\'s going to be a long second half. 21:32 31mins A third corner of the game for Almeria but the delivery is to the far post and again goes beyond everyone. 21:28 28mins: GOAL! REAL MADRID 1-0 Almeria No chance for Esteban and Real Madrid take a deserved lead! Angel Di Maria picks the ball up on the right hand side, cuts inside and drives into the box. The Almeria goalkeeper who has been excellent up to this point can do nothing as he puts the ball right in the top corner. Almeria were down to 10 men as that goal went in. Mobbed: Angel di Maria celebrates with team-mates after scoring the opener 21:27 26mins Bale looks like he should score but the angle is too tight. A through-ball sets the Welshman off and he nips in to take it round Esteban, but the onrushing keeper does well. Despite going round him there\'s no angle for the shot. Narrow: Esteban does well to narrow the angle as Bale goes through on goal 21:25 25mins Another good chance for Benzema, though you can\'t fault him for that miss. Di Maria fires in a cross from the left and Benzema leaps well but can\'t keep his header down. 21:23 22mins Brilliant save from Esteban! The winger bursts into the box going past two defenders, and just next to the penalty spot Bale tries to give Esteban the eyes. He shapes to shoot to Eteban\'s right but atually goes to the left, and the former Sevilla stopper is equal to the task. Superb goalkeeping 21:21 20mins Illarramendi loses a shoe in passing the ball into Bale, but the Welshman and fires from about 20 yards and it\'s always rising. Little bit scruffy from Real in the last couple of minutes. Thwarted: Isco knocks the ball away from Barbosa 21:19 19mins Isco done brilliantly to create himself a bit of room on the edge of the box but he rather rushes his pass, firing the ball into an area where Benzema can\'t reach it. 21:18 18mins Slow and deliberate pace to Real Madrid\'s play at the moment. 21:14 14mins Almeria win themselves a corner but the delivery is terrible and it flies past everyone and out for a goal kick. 21:12 12mins Having said that it only seems a matter of time before Real Madrid score. Gareth Bale bursts down the left and finds Karim Benzema, who can only lift his shot over the top. You\'d expect better from a player of his quality. 21:12 10mins Almeria are just working their way back into it at the moment, enjoying a little bit more pressure. Especially down the right hand side. 21:09 8mins Another long range shot troubles Esteban! Di Maria takes a potshot from about 30 yards out which the keeper punches straight up. He\'s put under pressure by Bale who is - harshly - judged to have fouled the goalkeeper. It looks like it\'s going to be a busy night for him. Penalised: Gareth Bale is juged to have fouled Esteban 21:07 6mins Another good save from Esteban, as he pushes a shot away to his right. It was Di Maria cut inside and curling the ball into the bottom corner. 21:03 4mins A great strike from Angel Di Maria rattles the crossbar, so unlucky! Esteban was beaten all ends up by that shot. 21:02 2mins Early chance for Almeria! The visitors win a corner and it\'s a free header at the back post, but it goes way, way over the top. 21:01 KICK-OFF Real Madrid get us started at the Bernabeu. 20:57 From Sportsmail\'s Pete Jenson at the Bernabeu Big roar goes up at the Bernabeu to the news that Barcelona have lost. All Real Madrid need to do now is beat Almeria who Madrid beat 8-1 last time they met here. 20:50 Team news Real Madrid: Diego Lopez, Varane, Pepe, Coentrao, Benzema, Bale, Nacho, Modric, Di Maria, Isco, Illarramendi. Almeria: Esteban, Nelson, Torsiglieri, Hans, Mane, Verza, Corona, Tebar, Barbosa, Zongo, Rodri. Missing: Cristiano Ronaldo misses out tonight because of a thigh injury 20:48 Hello Good evening everyone, welcome to live coverage of Real Madrid from the Bernabeu. There\'s no Cristiano Ronaldo for the home side tonight, but they should have more than enough firepower to brush past Almeria.

Minister for disabled people, Mike Penning MP, said he would look to prosecute clubs that failed to meet criteria designed to welcome supporters. A BBC report last month revealed that just three Premier League stadiums - Swansea\'s Liberty Stadium, St Mary\'s in Southampton, and the Cardiff City Stadium - provide the required number of wheelchair spaces.

Suarez\'s is yours for just £3,000 Fulham\'s Craven Cottage has the fewest wheelchair spaces provided as a percentage of Accessible Stadia Guide recommendations, the BBC investigation found. Tory MP for Hemel Hempstead Mr Penning said the report \'named and shamed\' poorly performing clubs and he had written to all Football League teams to remind them of their responsibilities. Speaking on the BBC\'s Breakfast programme today, the Tottenham fan said: \'Enough is enough. I\'m a football fan and my club, Spurs, is right at the bottom of this league table (on disability provision). \'There\'s so much money in the Football League, why can\'t (disabled) fans go and see their games the same way you and I can? \'What I\'ve said is \"sort your act out\". Sadly if you don\'t, the legislation is there for me to take prosecutions if I need to.\'  Small amount: Crystal Palace\'s Selhurst Park is one of only three Premier League grounds to meet standards  The Accessible Stadia Guide is a \'good practice guide\' for sporting facilities to meet the needs of disabled spectators and other users. It sets out minimum standards all new grounds have to meet in the provision, location and quality of facilities for disabled fans. Since the implementation of the Equality Act in 2010, and legislation dating back to 1995, it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers. Mr Penning said he has also written to the Football Association chairman, former BBC director-general Greg Dyke, and described the situation.  Crackdown: MP Mike Penning said he would look to prosecute clubs that failed to meet criteria  The MP said: \'It\'s not just about wheelchair access. You can get wheelchair access in but if you just plant them around the edge of the game, they don\'t feel part of the game, they don\'t feel part of the atmosphere. \'I want to build on the legacy from the Paralympics and football clubs need to use a piece of their loose change.\' In a statement, the Premier League said: \'All Premier League clubs have arrangements in place to provide access and facilities for disabled fans. The highest standards of access are generally at clubs with new grounds but all clubs, even those working within the constraints of older stadia, work hard to make sure that disabled fans can attend matches and enjoy their football. \'The Accessible Stadia Guide sets out agreed standards to be achieved when new grounds are designed or existing grounds rebuilt, however all clubs use those standards to assess existing provisions and guide them on how to make improvements. \'Particular attention is given to achieving stadium management solutions that make the best of the constraints and opportunities inherent in each stadium. This includes working with the fans to arrive at solutions that work for them, and providing special training for stewards and staff to ensure that appropriate assistance is given.\'   More...

Fulham are  desperate for points and Norwich enter the game with a new manager. I was shocked to see Chris Hughton sacked last weekend but only because of the timing. In terms of results, it’s been coming. Hughton helped establish Norwich in the Premier League last season, finishing a respectable 11th. The club took that as a sign of progress and backed their manager to the tune of £25m in the summer.    Shown the door: Hughton was sacked by Norwich, currently 17th in the table, after a dismal run of results Down the bottom: Norwich and Fulham face up in a huge relegation six-pointer at Craven Cottage More... Norwich\'s Premier League survival will not be decided by Fulham clash, insists Adams EXCLUSIVE: Sellars axed from Man City academy role as fears over homegrown quota grow Hull boss Bruce admits he will go \'off the wall\' if his team defeat old club Sheffield United in FA Cup semi-final FA charge Crawley defender Connolly with violent conduct for slapping Brentford fan during defeat at Griffin Park Carson hoping for Cup chance as Wigan look to repeat Wembley heroics The view from Manchester: Kagawa must stay! United can thrive with Japan star and Mata at heart of their attack For any club that is a healthy investment but for a club of Norwich’s size it is a huge sum. Eight players came in, including striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel for a club-record £8.6m. He has scored one goal. They showed enormous faith in Hughton and would have expected to see improvements. Instead they were sucked into a  relegation battle. Losing to West Brom last weekend was the final straw and the club lost patience. Norwich chief executive David McNally has clearly had his finger hovering over the trigger for some time. In February he revealed he had a list of replacements ready to take over from Hughton, so the question is, why leave it until the last five games? Norwich have won just three of their last 18 league fixtures and conceded 17 goals in their last six away games. In their minds, Norwich have made this a 34-game season because their final four matches, against Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal are so tough. Making his point: David McNally (left) says the club were faced with no option then to sack Hughton That has created a panic and desperation in their play. That desperation has gripped everyone at the club and culminated in Hughton getting sacked. Have recent performances suggested they are going to get anything at Craven Cottage? Probably not. With the following four games a write-off, the board have gambled and tried to make one last change to secure their survival. If it works, it could be an inspired decision but I can’t help feeling it would have been better to keep Hughton on. Vital victory: Hugo Rodallega and Lewis Holtby (right) celebrate Fulham\'s 2-1 win over Aston Villa   Former Under 18s boss Neil Adams has been promoted and even if he manages for another 50 years, he will not face a bigger task. Norwich have not lacked willingness or quality, but Adams needs to change the mood, calm his players and  spread some belief. With the upheaval at Norwich, Fulham will feel this is their chance. They have been in the top flight since 2001 and will not go down without a fight. Roy Hodgson led their great escape in 2008 and a win on Saturday will give them the belief they can overhaul Norwich. That is some turnaround, given how far adrift they were.  Waste: Ricky van Wolfswinkel (left) was brought in by Chris Hughton and has scored just one league goal  I was relegated with Aston Villa and there is no worse feeling. Playing in the top flight gives you an enormous sense of pride and trying to get promoted the following season was the hardest of my career. There is more than money and glamour at stake. The whole world knows about the Premier League and people don’t realise just how much that status means to a player. It is a part of who you are and, make no mistake, the players will have to fight for it on Saturday.  Praying: Sunderland are also fighting for their lives at the bottom of the Premier League  PS Sunday is the cut-off date for a two-match ban for 10 yellow cards. Steven Gerrard, Ramires, Gareth Barry, and Cheick Tiote are all on nine. All are vital for their clubs and nobody will want to sit out crucial games. Time to tread carefully.  Thin ice: Both Steven Gerrard (left) and Ramires (right) are one booking away from a two-match ban   Spotlight on: Lewis Grabban, Bournemouth, Age 26 Bournemouth are on the march and are now within touching distance of the play-offs. They are on a good run of form, winning their last five matches, and Lewis Grabban has been a big part of that with five goals in those games. He is an  eye-catching striker who is quick, confident in front of goal and causes problems for every defender he faces. There was talk of him leaving in January but he signed a new deal and that is testament to the good job manager Eddie Howe is doing at the club in his second spell there. Howe got them promoted from League One last season and they are having another good year. The positive environment he creates is a major reason why Grabban is still there and why he is in such good form.  Hit man: Grabban has scored five goals in five games, with Bournemouth on fine form   More...

Watson has held or shared the lead after 36 holes eight times on the PGA Tour, but only converted one of those into a victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans in 2011. And the left-hander\'s task would not be made easier by the presence of defending champion Adam Scott on the leaderboard, the Australian recovering from three bogeys in the first five holes of his second round to lie just four off the pace.  Leader: Bubba Watson reacts after making a huge birdie putt on the 14th green on Friday   Another birdie: Watson hits his superb tee shot on the 16th hole during his second-round 68   Experience: The Florida native is bidding for a second Masters title after his victory two years ago  Watson, who adopted a month-old son with his wife Angie shortly before his Masters win in 2012, withdrew from his last event after blaming an opening 83 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on his head being \'all discombobulated\' due to severe allergies.

Garcia and Watson are pretty in pink McIlroy scrapes through while Gallacher continues early Masters magic Bjorn puts in masterful performance having barely been an afterthought before Augusta But the 35-year-old from Bagdad, Florida, did claim his first PGA Tour title since the Masters in February, shooting back-to-back bogey-free rounds of 64 to win the Northern Trust Open. \'This year I\'m trying to get the (green) jacket back,\' said Watson, who had five birdies in a row from the 12th to card a 68 and finish seven under par. \'Media attention is on the defending champion. You\'re asked all these questions, can you defend, how are you going to play, how are you going to do this? You have to give up the green jacket. \'For me I didn\'t know how to handle it the best way and so I didn\'t play my best golf last year. But this year I came in here with no media attention, somehow I was lost in the crowd a little so I could go about my practice rounds without much attention.\' Australian John Senden matched Watson\'s 68 to claim second place on four under, with Thomas Bjorn also returning a 68 to lie a shot further back alongside Scott, 20-year-old American Jordan Spieth and Sweden\'s Jonas Blixt.  Lurking: Australian John Senden is Watson\'s nearest challenger, trailing by three shots   Dangerman: Defending champion Adam Scott is four shots behind Watson at the halfway stage   Looking good: Welshman Jamie Donaldson is leading the British charge on one under par  \'I was a little frail but patience came into it on the back nine and I just tried to remember all the good shots I hit on Thursday,\' said Scott, who is aiming to join Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Tiger Woods in winning back-to-back titles. \'It\'s good to be within shouting distance but Saturday is a big day for everyone.

The Blues travel to Swansea on Sunday on the back of defeats to Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and PSG in successive games on their travels, and need to stop the rot to keep their Barclays Premier League title hopes from receding further.

Lukaku has been a revelation at Goodison Park since joining the Toffees on a season-long deal in September, having scored 14 goals in all competitions so far.  Wanted: Everton boss Roberto Martinez has admitted he wants to sign Romelu Lukaku on a permanent deal     Stellar campaign: Martinez\'s Everton are in the hunt for UEFA Champions League for the first time in nine years  Martinez recently revealed that the Merseyside outfit has more than £20million to spend for the next campaign even if the club don\'t qualify for next season\'s UEFA Champions League - with the Spaniard prepared to spend a large amount of that on the 20-year-old.   Speaking about Lukaku\'s future, Martinez is clear that he should stay with Everton where he is playing regularly. He said: \'I think if there is something we can give that he can’t get elsewhere it’s enjoying his football.    Joy: Lukaku (right) celebrates with Martinez (left) after scoring in Everton\'s 3-0 win vs Arsenal last weekend  \'In football, as a player, you can take football happiness for granted very quickly. As a young man to be important in a football club and being happy is vital. \'Nobody can guarantee you that unless you’ve experienced it, or know who you are going to work with.

PREMIER LEAGUE LIVE: All the action as it happens from around the grounds MARTIN KEOWN\'S BOOT ROOM: Hughton deserved sacking, but the timing was all wrong before Fulham clash... and it could cost Norwich their top flight place SUNDERLAND vs EVERTON: All the latest team news and stats as visitors maintain charge for the Champions League Mourinho is a specialist in winning while Arsenal are just laughable... it\'s the reader comments of the week Everton would be nowhere near Champions League without loan stars like Lukaku... but where would your side be in the table? Martinez blasts loan criticism as \'ridiculous\' and \'lazy\' as Everton march towards Europe Everton currently sit fifth in the Barclays Premier League but victory at relegation-threatened Sunderland on Saturday would see the side move above Arsenal with five games to go. At present Lukaku\'s future is unclear, with his parent club Chelsea unsure whether or not to keep the striker next season.  Blue is the colour: Lukaku joined parent club Chelsea from Belgian side Anderlecht for £18million in 2011     The Belgian international joined the Blues from Anderlecht for £18 million in 2011 but he could be used by Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as part of a deal to bring Atletico Madrid talisman Diego Costa to Stamford Bridge. Another reason why Martinez is keen to keep hold of the Belgian international is because it will save Everton having to find a ready-made replacement that suits their style of play.  Bargaining tool? Chelsea may use Lukaku as part of a deal to sign Atletico Madrid star Diego Costa    The Spaniard added: \'You are not gambling on him doing things well, because you know what he can bring and it’s a perfect fit in that respect. \'I think if you look at the way he has developed this season he’s aware of that. \'If we can extend his stay then fantastic, if not we will have great memories.\' Everton will also sit down with Lukaku’s compatriot Kevin Mirallas in the summer to discuss a new contract for the forward with his current deal set to expire in 2016.

Four of those seven are at home and coming against Sunderland, West Bromwich, Aston Villa and West Ham, should yield a maximum 12 points from 12. But the three outstanding away fixtures - at Liverpool, Crystal Palace and Everton - will be a real source of trepidation for City fans.  Apprehensive: Manuel Pellegrini\'s Manchester City still have their title destiny in their hands but face three away games in the run-in at teams they traditionally perform badly against - Liverpool, Everton and Crystal Palace   Tough: City have seven games remaining to overhaul Liverpool\'s four-point advantage, starting with a trip to Anfield this weekend   On course: City beat Southampton 4-1 last weekend to continue their title charge   Home stretch: City enjoy two games in hand on Liverpool but can\'t afford any slip-ups  TRAVEL SICKNESS CITY\'S AWAY RECORD VS LIVERPOOLPlayed 16 Won 1 Drawn 5 Lost 10Average points gained 0.5CITY\'S AWAY RECORD VS EVERTONPlayed 16 Won 2 Drawn 4 Lost 10Average points gained 0.63CITY\'S AWAY RECORD VS PALACEPlayed 3 Won 1 Drawn 1 Lost 1 Average points gained 1.33 They have rarely performed well on Merseyside during the Premier League era, and have only won once at Palace in three attempts. City travel to Anfield for Sunday\'s title showdown having only won there once in 16 attempts since 1992. They have managed five draws and lost on 10 occasions, with that sole victory coming way back in May 2003 when a late Nicolas Anelka goal handed them a 2-1 win. City have played 44 different opponents during the Premier League era and they have worse away records against only Arsenal (17 matches, 1 win) and Cardiff (1 match, 0 wins). Their record at Everton, where they visit on May 3, is almost as bad. With just two victories from 16 attempts, it\'s City\'s sixth worst opponent on the road.  Repeat performance? Man City lifted the Premier League title in 2012   Rare success: Nicolas Anelka scored twice the last time City won at Anfield - a 2-1 scoreline back in May 2003   Him again: Anelka also scored twice when Manchester City recorded their only win at Crystal Palace back in September 2004   Enlarge   On the road: Manchester City\'s away record against the 44 opponents they have faced in the Premier League era  CITY\'S TITLE RUN-IN April 13 Liverpool (A)April 16 Sunderland (H)April 21 West Bromwich (H)April 27 Crystal Palace (A)May 3 Everton (A)May 7 Aston Villa (H)May 11 West Ham (H) City must also go to Crystal Palace on April 27 and have won just one of their three encounters at Selhurst Park.

But his average is everybody else\'s outstanding so Timothy Bradley has to be on top form if he is to beat him for a second time in Las Vegas on Saturday night.  The first fight was very tight to call and this will decide it all. Both fighters are at different stages in their careers and a lot has changed since the first fight and that’s why I think Bradley will edge it.  Looking good: Timothy Bradley plans to stun Manny Pacquiao for a second time in their rematch in Las Vegas   Can\'t hear you: Bradley remains underrated, particularly compared to the ever-popular Pacquiao   I was at that fight two years ago and the after party was not set up for Bradley to win. It wasn’t expected to be done but he shut the shop. It was mad to suggest he would get the win, never mind the decision.  I saw him first hand, he had a great game plan, he was an excellent physical specimen and a good boxing brain. Timothy Bradley is a rising star and he’s getting better and better with every performance but he’s not getting the credit he’s due. That must be incredibly frustrating for him. He has gone up a notch since the first fight, beating Ruslan Provodnikov and Juan Manuel Marquez. He has been hurt and he feels as though he\'s got something to prove. He\'s in a very strong position and is just on the brow of that hill.   Shock: Pacquiao was the overwhelming favourite to beat Bradley in 2012 but lost on points   Tough: Bradley has never received the recognition he deserves for his victories in recent years   Pacquiao has to use speed, movement and consistent, unpredictable pressure if he is to win the fight. What I mean by that is he needs to use a tormenting pressure like he did against Oscar De La Hoya. He was in, he was out; he was in, he was out. He wouldn’t give De La Hoya breathing space and that\'s what he\'s got to do with Bradley. The problem is, Bradley can also do that but his work is not as tidy as an on-form Pacquiao but we’re talking about of Pacquiao of old – he wouldn’t have been knocked sparked out by Marquez so we know he\'s slipping and he\'s making mistakes.  That\'s why I see Bradley winning on points in a close decision.   Rolling back the years: Pacquiao must pressure Bradley in the same way he did to Oscar De La Hoya   Still got it? Many have questioned if Pacquiao is still capable of re-producing the performances of yesteryear    More... Millions involved and revenge at stake... Pacquiao vs Bradley has the potential to be the most epic contest in years PacMan of the people: Manny\'s the superstar statesman who entertains and serves his fellow Filipinos - and he\'s out for revenge against Bradley Is Pacquiao all talk?

Table for 12.30pm. Usual sort of spot: Sloane Square area of Chelsea. The old FIA president\'s conversation topics were as catholic as usual: judges, whose ranks he half-wished he had joined rather than been lured by motor racing from an early career at the bar; newspaper editors and proprietors, whose journals he has waged war upon; Bernie Ecclestone, his old mucker who finds himself in a spot of bother with the German constabulary.

An opportunity has been missed.\' A few points to consider. First, he turned upside down Ecclestone\'s argument that louder engines are obviously desirable, saying that quieter power trains are not only a necessary by-product of less energy being expelled through the exhaust but that the tranquillity is desirable in itself. He cited watching the sheer violence of a car going round the swimming pool at Monaco, rather than the high-decibel screech, as the truly jaw-dropping spectacle. I agree that watching from the pit wall at Monaco is one of the greatest sights in all sport, and I stop there every year to take it in. Secondly, he argued that Formula One is not shying away from being the most innovative and startling brand in motor racing by moving to a greener world but actually defining the new frontiers by doing so.  Complaint: Luca di Montezemolo has been very outspoken in his criticism of the new Formula One era  More... US team set for Formula One bow in 2015 as FIA accept entrant from NASCAR ace Haas Horner claims Ricciardo is among the best after youngster enjoys fine start at Red Bull Rosberg drives \'from London to Paris and back\' in bid to stop Hamilton winning title Hamilton shies away from the cameras after meal with girlfriend Nicole in London I\'m coming for you, Lewis: Rosberg in promise to win Chinese GP after losing out to Hamilton in brilliant Bahrain battle Thirdly, he underlined the fact there would only be one or possibly two engine manufacturers left had the move to energy-saving technology not been brought in. Mercedes, for one, said this week they probably would have quit had the move not come about. Renault would have wobbled, too. Despite these and other worthy points to be made for the new regulations, the agenda through the opening months of the season was set by the antis, notably Ferrari\'s Luca di Montezemolo, Red Bull\'s world champion Sebastian Vettel and, of couse, Ecclestone. Where was the case for the defence from the sport\'s governors, as opposed to Mercedes\' Niki Lauda and, to an extent, McLaren\'s Ron Dennis? Their argument was barely presented, certainly not with the force or coherence it could have been. Instead, the telling rebuttal was delivered, by proxy, through the splendid racing at Bahrain last weekend. But even that evidence, by its nature, failed to make the intellectual case for the revolutionary changes. Another chance to articulate this vision was, I fear, missed this week when the FIA launched its carbon reduction programme. The project was a long time in the planning but was launched with little more than a murmur. The opportunity to join the dots with what is happening in Formula One was wastefully scorned. As for Mosley\'s views on Ecclestone\'s longevity, he believes his old friend will survive the bribery charges in Germany. Or was that just loyalty talking?  Centre of attention: Bernie Ecclestone will be tried on bribery charges in Munich later this year  Back on the pit wall: McLaren chief Ron Dennis pictured at the Bahrain Grand Prix  Mosley memoirs could dent knighthood dreams for Dennis The Piranha Club – the name given to Formula One\'s school of sharp-toothed bosses – should be warned that Mosley has finished his memoirs. I am told that about 10 per cent of the book, which has yet to be given a title, will address his upbringing as the son of Sir Oswald Mosley and Diana Mitford; 25 per cent his campaign to curtail the Press following the News of the World expose into his private life; 65 per cent his experience in and around Formula One. A particularly intrigued piranha will be Ron Dennis, whose designs on a knighthood are unlikely to be helped by another rehearsal of the Spygate scandal, concerning how McLaren came into illicit possession of Ferrari technical data in 2007. Other big fish who could also be wounded by Mosley\'s scabrous pen are Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo and triple world champion Sir Jackie Stewart. The author, during his period as FIA president, derided them respectively as a \'bella figura\' and a \'certificated halfwit, dressed up as a 1930s\' Music Hall man.\' Watch out. Hunt\'s son rekindles motor racing career If I were a modern-day Lord Hesketh – that is to say richer than I am – I would put some money towards the motor racing career of James Hunt\'s son, Freddie. With his collar-length blond hair, Freddie looks every inch his world champion father\'s boy. He also possesses something of the late James\'s debonair style. So it was one of the pleasures of the week to meet up with Freddie in a London hotel after his return from a spell in Argentina, close to the animals he loves.  Up for the cup: James Hunt celebrating victory at the 1977 British Grand Prix   Like father, like son: Freddie Hunt at the Goodwood Festival of Speed last year and, right, during a photo shoot  He told me how he spent New Year crossing the Andes, 15,000 feet up, sometimes holding on to rock faces for dear life, at other times pausing to breathe in the thin air every 10 steps. He managed just over 50 miles in fractionally fewer hours but had to turn back when there were no horses to take him across the water. The cowboys were on a day off. It was New Year, after all. But, his head cleared and straight, he is back in Britain in an attempt to restart his racing career seven years after he began out in Formula Ford. Aged 26, he admits his original aim of Formula One is beyond him, so is now hell-bent on a crack at Le Mans. The road to Le Mans, through lower categories, will likely take five years at best, and plenty of money. So if anyone fancies helping Freddie on his journey, he can be contacted on Twitter, @FreddieHunt76. PS I am willing to publicise other drivers seeking sponsorship, on only two conditions: first, that they are the son of a Formula One world champion and, secondly, they represent some of the panache missing in modern British sport.

I agree that watching from the pit wall at Monaco is one of the greatest sights in all sport, and I stop there every year to take it in. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Secondly, he argued that Formula One is not shying away from being the most innovative and startling brand in motor racing by moving to a greener world but actually defining the new frontiers by doing so. </font><br/></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Complaint: Luca di Montezemolo has been very outspoken in his criticism of the new Formula One era\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"414\" id=\"i-ab1d0e7f\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/11/article-2602858-1CE1F92400000578-999_634x414.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Complaint: Luca di Montezemolo has been very outspoken in his criticism of the new Formula One era</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"moduleHalf\"><div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div> <div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/formulaone/article-2602806/US-team-set-Formula-One-bow-2015-FIA-accept-entrant-NASCAR-ace-Haas.html\"> US team set for Formula One bow in 2015 as FIA accept entrant from NASCAR ace Haas</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/formulaone/article-2601725/Christian-Horner-claims-Daniel-Ricciardo-best-youngster-enjoys-fine-start-Red-Bull.html\"> Horner claims Ricciardo is among the best after youngster enjoys fine start at Red Bull</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/formulaone/article-2600543/Rosberg-drives-London-Paris-bid-stop-Hamilton-winning-title.html\"> Rosberg drives \'from London to Paris and back\' in bid to stop Hamilton winning title</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/formulaone/article-2602373/Lewis-Hamilton-shies-away-cameras-meal-Nicole-Scherzinger.html\"> Hamilton shies away from the cameras after meal with girlfriend Nicole in London</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/formulaone/article-2598780/Nico-Rosberg-promise-win-Chinese-Grand-Prix-losing-Lewis-Hamilton-brilliant-Bahrain-battle.html\"> I\'m coming for you, Lewis: Rosberg in promise to win Chinese GP after losing out to Hamilton in brilliant Bahrain battle</a></li> </ul> </div>   </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Thirdly, he underlined the fact there would only be one or possibly two engine manufacturers left had the move to energy-saving technology not been brought in. Mercedes, for one, said this week they probably would have quit had the move not come about. Renault would have wobbled, too. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Despite these and other worthy points to be made for the new regulations, the agenda through the opening months of the season was set by the antis, notably Ferrari\'s Luca di Montezemolo, Red Bull\'s world champion Sebastian Vettel and, of couse, Ecclestone. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Where was the case for the defence from the sport\'s governors, as opposed to Mercedes\' Niki Lauda and, to an extent, McLaren\'s Ron Dennis? Their argument was barely presented, certainly not with the force or coherence it could have been. Instead, the telling rebuttal was delivered, by proxy, through the splendid racing at Bahrain last weekend. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">But even that evidence, by its nature, failed to make the intellectual case for the revolutionary changes.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"> Another chance to articulate this vision was, I fear, missed this week when the FIA launched its carbon reduction programme. The project was a long time in the planning but was launched with little more than a murmur. The opportunity to join the dots with what is happening in Formula One was wastefully scorned. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">As for Mosley\'s views on Ecclestone\'s longevity, he believes his old friend will survive the bribery charges in Germany.

From a performance blamed on chronic allergies to the sweet perfume of perfection. Welcome to the never dull, box office world of Bubba Watson. Who knows what might happen next as the 35 year old from Bagdad, Florida takes a three stroke advantage over Australian John Senden into the weekend after a second round 68 featuring no fewer than five successive birdies on the back nine. Perhaps it will be a couple of 68s to win by a street. Or it\'s just as likely to be a pair of 78s to become a footnote in the chronicle of this 80th anniversary edition.  Box office: Bubba Watson plays his third shot on the 18th hole  Mind you, Rory McIlroy\'s fate is in danger of being that already following an afternoon filled with an extraordinary collection of mishaps. The favourite coming into the event flew the green at the par three fourth and finished in the bushes against a perimeter wall, with the consequence being he had to go back to the tee. In the end, following his provisional, he played a good bunker shot simply to limit the damage to a double bogey five. At the par four 10th he suffered another double bogey following another poorly executed approach. All that, however, was just a prelude to the unlucky par five 13th, where his second shot was tugged a fraction, landed on a sprinker head by the side of the green and bounded into the azaleas behind the target. Another bogey six there and McIlroy was putting together one of those horror sequences we have seen all too often from him at Augusta and turn his favourite event into a perennial nightmare. Luck continued to be against him right to the end, as his second shot to the 18th failed to come down a ridge in the green and finish next to the hole. \'What is holding that up, a grain of sand?\' asked Sir Nick Faldo, on American television. Now McIlroy had to get down in two putts from above the hole simply to make the halfway cut, and he finished 5ft away with his first effort. Thankfully for the sake of the event, he knocked it in to complete a tough day at the office. But at least he is around for the weekend – albeit 11 off the lead – which is more than can be said for the likes of Open Champion Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia.   Tense: Watson takes a three stroke advantage into the weekend  More... AUGUSTA TEE ROOM: Daly is still a big draw at Hooters... Garcia and Watson are pretty in pink He\'s the real McCoy but angry Augusta eats up 17-over-par Mike Augusta\'s Got Talent: Ant and Dec join Wozniacki in watching McIlroy\'s slog in the sun at the Masters Donald admits he was \'pretty dumb\' after bunker gaffe puts him at risk of Masters cut AUGUSTA TEE ROOM: Johnson doesn\'t just have Gretzky behind him... Real superstar Bale is also cheering American on in Spain \'It was just a really frustrating day,\' said McIlroy. \'There was a massive wind switch at the 4th and then at the 13th I hit the sprinkler head. I thought I played well after that but just couldn\'t make any putts. But I\'m still here, and hope to go low in the third round.\' Defending champion Adam Scott\'s defence was also in danger of fading away when he bogeyed three holes early on. But he showed the mettle of a champion on the back nine, coming home in 33 shots for a 72 that leaves him tied for third place. And so the UK challenge this weekend will be spearheaded by the unlikely duo who are threatening to take their unsung but impressive skills all the way to the Ryder Cup. Scotland\'s Stephen Gallacher, playing in his first Masters, added a 72 to his first round 71 to be six off the lead, alongside Jamie Donaldson from Wales, who shot 70.   Unlucky: Rory McIlroy hits out of the azaleas to the 13th green The leading Europeans on three under are American-based Swede Jonas Blixt and Thomas Bjorn, a 200-1 shot highlighted by Mail Online earlier in the week as an outstanding each-way bet. Bjorn shot 68. The other player on three under going into the weekend is America\'s remarkable rookie, Jordan Spieth. Just 20, who seems to be in contention practically every week. Watson won the green jacket two years ago with a shot at the first play-off hole that showcased his wonderful natural ability, as he moved the ball 30 yards from left to right through the air with a wedge. Last year, though, he fell off the charts. Any reason? Watson gave a wonderful response. \'Think about it for a moment and where I came from,\' he said. \'My mum took on two jobs to give me a chance at golf. I\'ve never had a lesson. Wouldn\'t it take you a bit of time to get over it if you were called Bubba and you\'d come so far that you won the green jacket?  That was such an accomplishment for me there had to a hangover. In fact, I think I am still celebrating.\'   Rough times: Caddie Jean-Paul Fitzgerald looks for McIlroy\'s ball on the fourth hole  Bjorn\'s renaissance has seen him tip-toe to the brink of Europe\'s Ryder Cup team and continued with a round illustrating his wonderful short game. \'It was right up there with the best rounds I have played at Augusta,\' said the 43 year old Dane, who had so many opportunities to win a major during his thirties. \'I felt comfortable on the course all day and that\'s always a good sign you\'re swinging well.\' Gallacher was similarly content. \'I\'m delighted with that,\' he said. \'It feels great to be in red numbers when you know if you\'re in the wrong places even a bogey is a good score.\'  Impressive: Scotland\'s Stephen Gallacher added a 72 to his first round 71  This is a huge event in itself for Gallacher, who is experiencing the aura of Augusta for the first time at 40. But it\'s a massive tournament in the bigger picture as well, as the quiet man from Linlithgow looks to close in on his primary goal for the season of a place in Europe\'s team at a Ryder Cup taking place just 30 minutes from his home. Right now, he\'s clinging to the 9th and last automatic slot. A good tournament here would certainly impress Europe\'s captain Paul McGinley, who is present and keeping a hawk\'s eye on proceedings. There was much to enjoy as Gallacher displayed his art and craft on another peachy morning in the Deep South. At the third, he left himself in a tricky spot just off the green but \'bladed\' an exquisite wedge shot to within inches of the hole. What was most impressive was the manner in which Gallacher kept bouncing back from bogeys. It happened on four occasions in all and has earned him his lofty spot.   Composed: Gallacher talks with his caddie Damian Moore on the second hole  As for Donaldson, there\'s seemingly no stopping him these days, as the late developing Welshman played the front nine in 33 shots to clamber on to the leaderboard. At his first Masters last year he had a hole in one at the 6th, and this trip is turning into another memorable one. It\'s an indication of his growing belief at this level that he didn\'t feel like he played that well but still shot two under. \'It was a real struggle for me off the tee, so I\'m pleased to finish with such a good score,\' he said. As for the gilded English quartet, they all rebounded from their opening day calamities. Lee Westwood has a superb recent record here and has an opportunity to extend it after a 71 left him inside the top 15, seven shots off the lead.  Confident: Jamie Donaldson, of Wales, watches his putt on the 18th green  US Open Champion Justin Rose bounced back well from an opening 76 with a 70 to be two further shots adrift, as did Ian Poulter, on the same mark after two identical scores. Luke Donald, however, was a shade unfortunate to miss out by a stroke despite improving nine shots on his first round 79. Two more to miss the cut were the English amateurs, Matt Fitzpatrick and Garrick Porteous. The latter missed by a large margin but 19 year old Fitzpatrick from Sheffield recovered so well from his wretched double bogey on the first hole on Thursday that he actually stood over a 12ft birdie putt on the last to make it to the weekend. Alas for him, it slipped by and the disappointment was obvious. Still, he must have learned so much from one playing partner, Scott, and actually beat the other, USPGA Champion Jason Dufner, by three shots. He will be back.  Up for it: Thomas Bjorn\'s renaissance has seen him tip-toe to the brink of Europe\'s Ryder Cup team    More... AUGUSTA TEE ROOM: Daly is still a big draw at Hooters...

Or it\'s just as likely to be a pair of 78s to become a footnote in the chronicle of this 80th anniversary edition.</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Box office: Bubba Watson plays his third shot on the 18th hole\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"454\" id=\"i-5ddb0d40\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D09BC7B00000578-513_634x454.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Box office: Bubba Watson plays his third shot on the 18th hole</p> </div>\n<div class=\"moduleHalf\">  <div class=\"home item html_snippet_module\"> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"346\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless=\"\" src=\"http://opta.mc.cloud.opta.net/configurable/index.html?mc=dmgolf1\" width=\"318\"></iframe> </div> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Mind you, Rory McIlroy\'s fate is in danger of being that already following an afternoon filled with an extraordinary collection of mishaps. The favourite coming into the event flew the green at the par three fourth and finished in the bushes against a perimeter wall, with the consequence being he had to go back to the tee. In the end, following his provisional, he played a good bunker shot simply to limit the damage to a double bogey five. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> At the par four 10th he suffered another double bogey following another poorly executed approach. All that, however, was just a prelude to the unlucky par five 13th, where his second shot was tugged a fraction, landed on a sprinker head by the side of the green and bounded into the azaleas behind the target. Another bogey six there and McIlroy was putting together one of those horror sequences we have seen all too often from him at Augusta and turn his favourite event into a perennial nightmare.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> Luck continued to be against him right to the end, as his second shot to the 18th failed to come down a ridge in the green and finish next to the hole. \'What is holding that up, a grain of sand?\' asked Sir Nick Faldo, on American television. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> Now McIlroy had to get down in two putts from above the hole simply to make the halfway cut, and he finished 5ft away with his first effort. Thankfully for the sake of the event, he knocked it in to complete a tough day at the office. But at least he is around for the weekend – albeit 11 off the lead – which is more than can be said for the likes of Open Champion Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia. </font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Tense: Watson takes a three stroke advantage into the weekend\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"486\" id=\"i-5dda0d46\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D09A1FE00000578-137_634x486.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Tense: Watson takes a three stroke advantage into the weekend</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"moduleHalf\">  <div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div> <div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/golf/article-2602892/John-Daly-big-draw-Hooters-Sergio-Garcia-Bubba-Watson-pretty-pink.html\"> AUGUSTA TEE ROOM: Daly is still a big draw at Hooters...

I thought I played well after that but just couldn\'t make any putts. But I\'m still here, and hope to go low in the third round.\'</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Defending champion Adam Scott\'s defence was also in danger of fading away when he bogeyed three holes early on. But he showed the mettle of a champion on the back nine, coming home in 33 shots for a 72 that leaves him tied for third place. </font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">And so the UK challenge this weekend will be spearheaded by the unlikely duo who are threatening to take their unsung but impressive skills all the way to the Ryder Cup. Scotland\'s Stephen Gallacher, playing in his first Masters, added a 72 to his first round 71 to be six off the lead, alongside Jamie Donaldson from Wales, who shot 70. </font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Unlucky: Rory McIlroy hits out of the azaleas to the 13th green\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"474\" id=\"i-5c3b0d33\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D0A55B800000578-822_634x474.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Unlucky: Rory McIlroy hits out of the azaleas to the 13th green</p></div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The leading Europeans on three under are American-based Swede Jonas Blixt and Thomas Bjorn, a 200-1 shot highlighted by Mail Online earlier in the week as an outstanding each-way bet. Bjorn shot 68. The other player on three under going into the weekend is America\'s remarkable rookie, Jordan Spieth. Just 20, who seems to be in contention practically every week.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Watson won the green jacket two years ago with a shot at the first play-off hole that showcased his wonderful natural ability, as he moved the ball 30 yards from left to right through the air with a wedge. Last year, though, he fell off the charts.</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Any reason? Watson gave a wonderful response. \'Think about it for a moment and where I came from,\' he said. \'My mum took on two jobs to give me a chance at golf. I\'ve never had a lesson. Wouldn\'t it take you a bit of time to get over it if you were called Bubba and you\'d come so far that you won the green jacket?  That was such an accomplishment for me there had to a hangover. In fact, I think I am still celebrating.\'</font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Rough times: Caddie Jean-Paul Fitzgerald looks for McIlroy\'s ball on the fourth hole\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"485\" id=\"i-5a540d1f\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D0A288200000578-510_634x485.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Rough times: Caddie Jean-Paul Fitzgerald looks for McIlroy\'s ball on the fourth hole</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Bjorn\'s renaissance has seen him tip-toe to the brink of Europe\'s Ryder Cup team and continued with a round illustrating his wonderful short game.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"> \'It was right up there with the best rounds I have played at Augusta,\' said the 43 year old Dane, who had so many opportunities to win a major during his thirties. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">\'I felt comfortable on the course all day and that\'s always a good sign you\'re swinging well.\'</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Gallacher was similarly content. \'I\'m delighted with that,\' he said. \'It feels great to be in red numbers when you know if you\'re in the wrong places even a bogey is a good score.\'</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Impressive: Scotland\'s Stephen Gallacher added a 72 to his first round 71\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"451\" id=\"i-5d540d3c\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D07AE1A00000578-457_634x451.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Impressive: Scotland\'s Stephen Gallacher added a 72 to his first round 71</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">This is a huge event in itself for Gallacher, who is experiencing the aura of Augusta for the first time at 40. But it\'s a massive tournament in the bigger picture as well, as the quiet man from Linlithgow looks to close in on his primary goal for the season of a place in Europe\'s team at a Ryder Cup taking place just 30 minutes from his home. </font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Right now, he\'s clinging to the 9th and last automatic slot. A good tournament here would certainly impress Europe\'s captain Paul McGinley, who is present and keeping a hawk\'s eye on proceedings.</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">There was much to enjoy as Gallacher displayed his art and craft on another peachy morning in the Deep South. At the third, he left himself in a tricky spot just off the green but \'bladed\' an exquisite wedge shot to within inches of the hole. What was most impressive was the manner in which Gallacher kept bouncing back from bogeys. It happened on four occasions in all and has earned him his lofty spot.</font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Composed: Gallacher talks with his caddie Damian Moore on the second hole\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"448\" id=\"i-5c760d35\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D07DC5400000578-821_634x448.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Composed: Gallacher talks with his caddie Damian Moore on the second hole</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">As for Donaldson, there\'s seemingly no stopping him these days, as the late developing Welshman played the front nine in 33 shots to clamber on to the leaderboard. At his first Masters last year he had a hole in one at the 6th, and this trip is turning into another memorable one.</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">It\'s an indication of his growing belief at this level that he didn\'t feel like he played that well but still shot two under. \'It was a real struggle for me off the tee, so I\'m pleased to finish with such a good score,\' he said. </font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">As for the gilded English quartet, they all rebounded from their opening day calamities. Lee Westwood has a superb recent record here and has an opportunity to extend it after a 71 left him inside the top 15, seven shots off the lead. </font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Confident: Jamie Donaldson, of Wales, watches his putt on the 18th green\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"475\" id=\"i-5cfe0d3d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D0A69B900000578-168_634x475.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Confident: Jamie Donaldson, of Wales, watches his putt on the 18th green</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">US Open Champion Justin Rose bounced back well from an opening 76 with a 70 to be two further shots adrift, as did Ian Poulter, on the same mark after two identical scores. Luke Donald, however, was a shade unfortunate to miss out by a stroke despite improving nine shots on his first round 79. </font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Two more to miss the cut were the English amateurs, Matt Fitzpatrick and Garrick Porteous. The latter missed by a large margin but 19 year old Fitzpatrick from Sheffield recovered so well from his wretched double bogey on the first hole on Thursday that he actually stood over a 12ft birdie putt on the last to make it to the weekend.</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Alas for him, it slipped by and the disappointment was obvious. Still, he must have learned so much from one playing partner, Scott, and actually beat the other, USPGA Champion Jason Dufner, by three shots.</font></p>\n<p> <font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">He will be back.</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Up for it: Thomas Bjorn\'s renaissance has seen him tip-toe to the brink of Europe\'s Ryder Cup team\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"462\" id=\"i-5aaa0d20\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-0-1D0971A800000578-160_634x462.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Up for it: Thomas Bjorn\'s renaissance has seen him tip-toe to the brink of Europe\'s Ryder Cup team</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div>\n<div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/golf/article-2602892/John-Daly-big-draw-Hooters-Sergio-Garcia-Bubba-Watson-pretty-pink.html\"> AUGUSTA TEE ROOM: Daly is still a big draw at Hooters...

It\'s a tough task picking a side from these squads. Liverpool have the edge in my team (right) with six players to City’s five, but that shows you just how far they have come this season. I think Mignolet has been more consistent than Hart and the same goes for my back four — all are reliable performers. Gerrard and Toure would be some midfield engine room while Liverpool’s attacking trio would be supported by Silva’s creative brilliance.  Dynamic duo: Lethal partnership Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge make it in over City\'s strikers   The midfield battle could decide this match. Brendan Rodgers knows about the threat of Yaya Toure and David Silva, so he may make some tweaks. He has not been afraid to tinker this season and I wouldn’t be surprised if he brings in Lucas or Joe Allen to support Steven Gerrard in combatting City’s power.  Key man: The midfield presence of Yaya Toure could go a long way into deciding the match   Martin Demichelis has played better in recent weeks, but he is still a weak link. Liverpool will attack him whenever they can and Luis Suarez will be licking his lips.   More...

Suarez\'s is yours for just £3,000 JAMIE CARRAGHER: Every child must be told why games kick off seven minutes late this weekend  174 The combined number of league goals scored by Liverpool (90) and City (84) this season. Everybody talks about the spirit at Anfield this season, but City are just as strong. I watched the Under 21 Premier League cup final this week and all of City’s top stars were there to support the youth team. Lots of the foreign stars have been there for a while now and they feel 100 per cent that this is their club.  Bend it like Becks? Aleksandar Kolarov\'s crossing is an underrated threat in City\'s arsenal Remember me? Kolarov\'s precision is every bit as good as United and England hero David Beckham  Kolarov delivers just like Beckham Not enough is made of Aleksandar Kolarov’s crossing ability. He whips balls into the area that are just begging to be put in the net. When he gets space down the left, he is just as good as David Beckham at putting in dangerous deliveries. City must get behind Gerrard If Liverpool win the league, this will be Steven Gerrard’s greatest ever season. But City will look to isolate him. If he plays alone in that deeper role, City can have success if they flood players in behind him. If Samir Nasri and David Silva can get themselves in behind Gerrard, they can use Edin Dzeko to draw out the centre halves and create space. The City midfielders can then exploit that with clever movement and work the ball in to create chances.  On target: The rejuvenated Steven Gerrard has been key to Liverpool\'s surprise title challenge Tactics: City will want to get behind the Liverpool midfield to create opportunities    More...

After all, the 43-year-old Dane had never finished higher than 18th and was a total of 51 over par for his previous 10 Masters appearances, while an opening 73 soon made that 52 over.  On form: Thomas Bjorn of Denmark put in a superb second-round performance, finishing three under Serene: Bjorn will hope to keep his calm throughout the week after comfortably making the cut   But a second round of 68 in testing conditions on Friday gave the world number 29 a halfway total of three under par, four shots behind clubhouse leader and 2012 champion Bubba Watson. \'It was a good day,\' Bjorn said after a round containing four bogeys and eight birdies, four of them coming in the last five holes. \'I played well all the way through. \'I hit two great shots on 13 and walked away with a five. I felt like I had to be a little bit more aggressive in my golf and I took on the shots on 14 and 16 and they paid off. And then it was good to get on the 18th and tap it in for a birdie and sign for 68. A good day\'s work.\' Bjorn\'s best finish in the Masters was back in 2002 and he revealed it was playing badly last year for a share of 46th that was the secret behind only a fifth sub-70 score in 34 rounds. \'I always felt like when I came in here I had to play so well to do any good,\' Bjorn added. \'And I came in here last year and played very poor and I think I finished just outside the top 40 or whatever. \'I felt like I\'ve learned so much from that week last year that I could, even without playing great, find the way around the golf course, put myself in positions.  In touch: Bjorn finished the day four shots off Bubba Watson in the lead at Augusta    \'It was probably the first time I really understood the golf course completely and when I came in this week I just felt like that\'s what you have to do. \'If you play well then you\'ve got a chance of putting good numbers together, but if you don\'t play very well you\'ve still got to try to position yourself and do the right things on the golf course and I certainly did that today. \'There\'s so many holes where you get yourself in a little bit of trouble and if you hit it here you\'ve got a pretty easy chip, but sometimes we get a little bit too cute with our golf, you take on too much and then it will bite you.\' Old and new champion?

The 21-year-old Belgian, in the third season of a loan from Stamford Bridge to Atletico Madrid, found himself in the middle of a huge contract row after the two clubs were pitted against each other by Friday morning’s draw. Atletico say there is a clause in his loan agreement stipulating they would have to pay a total of £5million to field him in both legs. But a strongly worded UEFA statement on Friday insisted the clause contravenes their regulations and so cannot be applied. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Thibaut Courtois in action for former club Genk  Decision: UEFA have warned Chelsea they can\'t stop Thibaut Courtois playing against them for Atleico Madrid  Champions League draw Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich Atletico Madrid vs Chelsea Ties to be played on 22-23 and 29-30 of April The statement read: ‘The integrity of sporting competition is a fundamental principle for UEFA. Both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA disciplinary regulations contain clear provisions which strictly forbid any club to exert, or attempt to exert, any influence whatsoever over the players that another club may (or may not) field in a match. ‘It follows that any provision in a private contract between clubs which might function in such a way as to influence who a club fields in a match is null, void and unenforceable so far as UEFA is concerned. ‘Furthermore, any attempt to enforce such a provision would be a clear violation of both the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA disciplinary regulations and would be sanctioned accordingly.’ It is understood Atletico’s decision to go public with the clause has angered Chelsea. The London club have maintained their stance to not discuss the finer details of the Courtois loan  contract, insisting on Friday such matters should stay confidential. But while they insist Courtois has always been eligible to face them, whether or not they would look to invoke the clause privately remains unclear.

Atletico want to secure another season-long loan deal for the Belgium international next season, while Chelsea want to sign Diego Costa from the Vicente Calderon Stadium and are said to be watching midfielder Arda Turan.One way of resolving the issue could see Atletico reducing Costa’s £32million release clause this summer to help Chelsea sign the star.That would mean Atletico would not be required to directly pay Chelsea any money, though such a move would be open to scrutiny.

This is the player’s third loan spell at Atletico and he feels loyal to the club. Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said on Friday: ‘The loan was arranged at the start of the season. He could play against Chelsea - that was never in doubt. ‘Regarding the (UEFA) statement that came out, we’ll evaluate it over the next 24 to 48 hours. As far as we’re concerned we complied with loan rules. He can play against Chelsea - if selected.’ Atletico director Clemente Villa-verde added: ‘Courtois can play, whatever happens. There is a UEFA regulation which prohibits any agreement between clubs that prevents a player from participating freely in the competition. The regulation would have been breached if the player had not been allowed the freedom to participate.’ Real Madrid face Bayern Munich in the other semi-final tie.

The fellow Ivorians are good friends, and Chelsea know they will need to keep Swansea striker Bony in check following his prolific form this season which has seen him amass 20 goals in all competitions. \'I have not spoken to him (Drogba) yet, but maybe tonight or tomorrow I will,\' Bony said. \'We are playing against Chelsea, so he can tell me some things.  Threat: The Ivorian (left) has scored 20 goals for Swansea this season   Bony drew a blank in Swansea\'s 1-0 defeat at Hull last weekend  \'He is my friend, we are in touch, so I will talk to him for some advice. \'I followed Chelsea when Didier was there. He was always with the national side, so we would see how they were doing. \'I saw the Champions League final against Bayern Munich. It was fabulous for him in his last game with Chelsea. Chelsea are a big club in the Ivory Coast, and he did well with the national side, too, so he is a big personality there.\' Former Chelsea hero Drogba has given Bony an insight into Blues manager Jose Mourinho, who remains on course to achieve a possible Premier League and Champions League double this term.  Bony celebrates after netting at the Emirates Stadium in the 2-2 draw with Arsenal  \'He told me he is a very good manager and that he is all about winning,\' Bony added. \'Sometimes they play well or sometimes they play bad, but the most important thing is to take the three points and then talk about what you can work on. \'If you don\'t win, that is not the point. That is the winning character he has.\' Bony has arguably been Swansea\'s most influential performer this season, and he will be critical to helping them collect the points they need to be safe from relegation. There could be few bigger games than Chelsea\'s Liberty Stadium visit on Sunday for him to showcase his talent.  Bony might get some advice on how to play Chelsea from Stamford Bridge legend Didier Drogba   Miguel Michu (right) hasn\'t scored for Swansea since October in an injury-ravaged season  \'I think as players you always want to play in big games,\' Bony said. \'For me, being a big player means playing in the big games. I have 12 league goals and just five more (league) games left. Getting 20 league goals would be nice. I want to score more. \'If you play bad people criticise you, if you score a hat-trick people sing your name, but the main thing is to stay yourself, do what you know and let other people talk. \'We have five more games and I will try to do my best and we\'ll see what will happen. \'I have three years left on my contract at Swansea, we have five games left and then the World Cup and we will see what happens.

A kid in a full home strip was juggling a football among the throng of autograph hunters while, along the road, another had climbed a ladder to see over the wall. Inside Melwood, it was throwback time, too, as Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers outlined his vision of Blitzkrieg football ahead of Sunday\'s titanic Anfield meeting with Barclays Premier League title rivals Manchester City.  Making his point: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is hoping to bring the glory days back to Anfield Getting used to it: Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness (left-right) lift the Milk Cup in 1984 Flying the flag: A grinning Peter Beardsley celebrates Liverpool winning the league in 1988  More...

We\'ve an army of supporters behind us who are incredible. We\'ve got a team high in confidence and belief, knowing we can beat anyone. \'At Anfield we\'ve taken a huge amount of points this year and that\'s not going to stop. \'Our confidence to play and to pass and to move and to press and to work will be even higher this weekend and that is something that will be great for us.\' Rodgers, still a young manager in modern terms, was 16-years-old when Liverpool last won the title in 1990. He was a trainee midfielder at Reading, fresh over from Northern Ireland. Few back then thought Liverpool would wait so long for another league triumph. Even fewer perhaps thought the spell would be broken this season. Liverpool, we should remind ourselves here, finished seventh last term.  On target: The rejuvenated Steven Gerrard has been key to Liverpool\'s surprise title challenge   Dynamic duo: Lethal partnership Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge will be major threats to the City defence  LOOK AWAY CITY! Liverpool have won all four home meetings with fellow members of the top seven so far this season, scoring 14 and conceding just once.Man City have only won one of their previous 16 Barclays Premier League matches at Anfield (D5 L10), with that win coming back in May 2003. Nicolas Anelka scored twice that day for the visitors. The scale of progress under Rodgers at Anfield has been immense and now Liverpool stand on the cusp of the most unexpected and fantastic glory. Victory over Manuel Pellegrini\'s City team tomorrow and Liverpool will lead them by seven at the top. Earlier this week, Kenny Dalglish, that most revered Anfield icon, commented that the current Liverpool reminded him of the old Liverpool. \'Everybody is in it together,\' he said. Prompted on this yesterday, Rodgers shoulders eased proud shoulders back just a fraction further. \'Kenny knows the club better than anyone and we are hugely privileged to receive that,\' he said. \'But we\'ve got to keep on working because we haven\'t achieved anything yet. I think what we\'ve shown is we are on the right road.\' Few would dispute that. Liverpool\'s football — so full of energy and forward thrust — has arguably been the best of this season, followed closely by that of Sunday\'s opponents.  Cheering them on: Rodgers vowed to \'unleash\' Liverpool fans on City in Sunday\'s clash  In some ways Rodgers and his team have already fulfilled their primary aim. They will play  Champions League football again next season and that, in relative terms, constitutes a successful year already. Pellegrini\'s attempts to place a little pressure on his opponent\'s shoulders yesterday seemed, therefore, a little clumsy. Rodgers, after all, isn\'t the manager who has been told by his chief executive to deliver five trophies in as many years. \'I can\'t believe that at such an important team as Liverpool, the manager has no pressure to win the title,\' said the City manager. \'I think everyone who manages Liverpool has that pressure.\' Rodgers and Pellegrini have a little crossover. City wanted Rodgers to work as assistant to Roberto Mancini a few years ago while Pellegrini was interviewed at Anfield before the appointment of Roy Hodgson. Certainly both are fine coaches and both have some issues to contend with tomorrow.  Presence: Can Liverpool match the physicality of City star Yaya Toure int the midfield battle?  The City manager will know that the pace and directness of players like Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling can seriously worry central defenders Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis if they are allowed to break on them. Rodgers, for his part, is aware that he cannot match Yaya Toure and Fernandinho for sheer physical power in midfield. Ultimately, the result may depend on who plays the occasion the better. Rodgers believes his team will be inspired — rather than awed — by the pre-match Hillsborough commemorations, but we must wait for proof of that. Pellegrini\'s players, meanwhile, must hope that European visits to Bayern Munich and Barcelona will help prepare them for what Liverpool believe will be a unique atmosphere.  Tribute: The backdrop to the match will be commemorating the 25th anniversary of Hillsbrorough  \'We will unleash our supporters,\' said Rodgers. \'I\'ve even sensed it myself recently, the roar is  different. Anfield is a different place from the drive up now.\' \'For us the supporters are really the ones that will push us over the line and they\'re the best supporters in the world.\' Occasionally, Rodgers has been accused of talking too much. Certainly he loves his football theory. On Friday, though, he struck the right tone. \'We score a lot of goals because we are relentless in our work to score,\' said Rodgers. \'I think City will probably know that.\' Back in the day, many visiting reams understood it well.\'  More...

Prompted on this yesterday, Rodgers shoulders eased proud shoulders back just a fraction further.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\'Kenny knows the club better than anyone and we are hugely privileged to receive that,\' he said. \'But we\'ve got to keep on working because we haven\'t achieved anything yet. I think what we\'ve shown is we are on the right road.\'</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Few would dispute that.

Rodgers, after all, isn\'t the manager who has been told by his chief executive to deliver five trophies in as many years.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\'I can\'t believe that at such an important team as Liverpool, the manager has no pressure to win the title,\' said the City manager. \'I think everyone who manages Liverpool has that pressure.\'</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Rodgers and Pellegrini have a little crossover.

Eden Hazard and Daniel Sturridge are the favourites but these five young stars also deserve to be high up in people’s thinking.  Clear favourite: Liverpool frontman Luis Suarez is odds-on to win the PFA Player of the Year award   Boy in Blue: Chelsea wideman Eden Hazard has been one of the standout performers for the Blues this season   Natural goalscorer: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has been lethal in front of the goal for the Reds   1. Raheem Sterling There was always a buzz around Raheem when I was at Liverpool but this season he has shown there is substance to the hype. He has been brilliant since getting back into the team, adding goals to his speed on the flanks, and he looks set to go to the World Cup.  Living up to the hype: Liverpool frontman Raheem Sterling has added goals to his game this season   2. Ross Barkley Back in August, when I wrote my second column for Sportsmail, I highlighted the Everton midfielder as one to watch and he has done nothing but improve. An explosive talent, with energy and two great feet, he is another who Roy Hodgson will come calling for in June.

Luke Shaw Scouts have been flocking to St Mary’s to see Shaw in action and it is no wonder the top clubs want to prise the left back away from Southampton. If he moves this summer, Shaw will command a huge fee but it will be warranted as he has consistently impressed.  Top talent: Southampton\'s Luke Shaw has attracted attention from a host of rival Premier League clubs   4. Adnan Januzaj Manchester United have endured a disappointing campaign but the one bright spot has been the emergence of Januzaj. He’s played 32 games, which is a lot for a  19-year-old, but he has a big future. I liked what I saw of him in pre-season and he has built on that impression.  Bright spot: Adnan Januzaj has shined in an otherwise disappointing campaign for Manchester United   5. John Stones Roberto Martinez is not afraid to give young players opportunities if they are good enough and Stones has impressed since being given his Everton chance. I like the way he uses the ball and it was interesting to see he completed 39 of the 40 passes he attempted against Arsenal last week.  Taking his chances: Everton defender John Stones (left) is equally adept at passing as he his tackling    More...

In a sensational twist to the convoluted takeover saga at Leeds, West Yorkshire Police have launched a theft investigation, which sources say relates to club funds used to install the cameras. Sportsmail understands that when controversial new owner Cellino arrived in Leeds on Wednesday to start taking charge of the club, a security sweep found the cameras in the boardroom and the toilets. New owner: Massimo Cellino, pictured right with Leeds boss Brian McDermott, took over the club this week  Old regime: David Haigh, formerly of GFH, in the stands at Elland Road Cellino called in the police, who spent Wednesday evening and much of Thursday trying to ascertain how the cameras got there, what money was used to pay for them and why anyone would want them installed.‘He’s clearly not thrilled that these cameras were there and the police are taking those concerns seriously,’ a source told Sportsmail.Italian Cellino, 57, officially became a board member of Leeds on Tuesday after his £35million deal to buy 75 per cent of the club from Bahrain bankers GFH was effectively given the green light last Saturday. The Football League gave him the all-clear after deeming that a tax-evasion offence in Italy was not due to dishonesty. It is not known who paid for the cameras to be fitted or where the money came from. A spokesman for GFH said: ‘We have no comment.’West Yorkshire Police would provide no detailed information about their investigation. Head of crime for Leeds, Dep Supt Pat Twiggs, said: ‘We can confirm that police are investigating an allegation of theft relating to Leeds United Football Club following a report made by the club on April 9. Rockstar: Cellino plays guitar with his band Maurilios and used AC/DC\'s \'Highway to Hell\' to describe Leeds Thumbs up: Cellino has made it his \'first priority\' to buy back the Championship club\'s Elland Road stadium ‘Enquiries are at an early stage and we are not in a position to give any further information.’Cellino has made clear he intends to run Leeds, who host Blackpool today, and that GFH - who retain 25 per cent of the club - and their personnel will be marginalised. In another twist last night, former GFH employee David Haigh, who had been contracted to become CEO in the Cellino regime, quit as managing director. Haigh said: ‘Owing to various statements made by and on behalf of the new majority owners of Leeds United, I am left with no alternative than to resign. ‘This is a matter of particular regret to me since I was the person who introduced Eleonora Sport (Cellino’s company) to the club’s owners.

Farah does not know how he will feel after 20 miles on the streets of the capital, if his ability on the track will convert to the gruelling demands of the road or how he will fare against one of the most competitive fields ever assembled over 26.2 miles. But the reigning Olympic champion at 10,000 metres and 5,000m knows one thing for certain: victory on The Mall would be the greatest feat of his career.  Home turf: Mo Farah runs along the riverside in front of London\'s famous Tower Bridge   National treasure: Mo Farah won two Olympic gold medals at London 2012 in the men\'s 5,000m and 10,000m  More... Bekele throws down the gauntlet as Farah\'s big rival sends out message with Paris win Farah gunning for British record at London marathon after collapse in New York Farah\'s Commonwealth plans depend on how he fares in Glasgow dress rehearsal Farah taken away in wheelchair after collapsing at the end of the New York half marathon Farah set for Glasgow... but for Diamond League (not Commonwealth Games) ‘It would be incredible — the greatest thing I’ve ever achieved, not just in terms of the London Marathon but in terms of the field and the people in it,’ he said. ‘At the London Olympics, I’m sure most believed that if I had a bad day I would finish third or fourth but here we don’t know what’s going to happen. ‘The public doesn’t quite understand because they’re so used to me winning. They just want me to win, but I’m as  clueless as everyone else. Yes, I have  covered 20 miles and a little bit but I haven’t covered the full distance at that pace. The only way to find out is to race.’ For any athlete, let alone a double Olympic and three-time world champion, this could be a terrifying thought. Farah ran half the distance last year to familiarise himself with the demands of marathon race day, but this will still be a new experience for a man so used to the routines, training and tactics of a 400m track. The Briton insists he is excited about taking on a new challenge after those hard months away from his family running up to 150 miles a week on the dirt tracks of Kenya’s Rift Valley, but he is still not the bookmakers’ favourite, despite home advantage. Wilson Kipsang, the world record holder, claimed Farah was ‘not a big threat’ this week but he, too, conceded we do not really know his capabilities. Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar, has advised the 31-year-old not to follow the near world-record pace expected to be set by Haile Gebrselassie, who will take the leading pack to the halfway mark in around 58 minutes. Ready and willing: Mo Farah insists he is not risking his reputation by taking on the London Marathon   Seeing stars: The long distance runner collapsed at the end of the New York half marathon in March    Up for it: Double Olympic champion Farah poses in front of Tower Bridge to promote the London marathon Instead, Farah will run about 30 seconds slower, ready to attack in the second half of the race. Patience will be crucial. If he goes off too quickly his race could be over before it has begun. More realistic success for Farah on his debut would be to break Steve Jones’s 1985 British record of 2hr 7min 13sec to add to the national marks he already holds at 1500m, 5,000m, 10,000m and the half-marathon. To be Britain’s best over so many distances  would be a phenomenal achievement, after all. Jones, now 58, expressed sadness that his record looks set to go but was surprised it had stood for nearly 29 years. His mark belongs to a different era  — Jones drank 10 pints of cider at a wedding the night before setting a new world half- marathon best in Birmingham in 1984. ‘Mo and I are miles apart, but I ran with no fear and I can’t see why Mo would have any fear,’ he said. ‘I’m just a journeyman compared with him. ‘It wouldn’t be a surprise if he shattered the British record. It wouldn’t surprise me if he won the race. He’s going to go down as one of the great British runners of all time.’ Farah’s place in such prestigious company is assured, but there should be no sense of disappointment or failure if he does not become the first British male winner since Eamonn Martin in 1993.

They just want me to win, but I’m as  clueless as everyone else. Yes, I have  covered 20 miles and a little bit but I haven’t covered the full distance at that pace. The only way to find out is to race.’ </font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">For any athlete, let alone a double Olympic and three-time world champion, this could be a terrifying thought. Farah ran half the distance last year to familiarise himself with the demands of marathon race day, but this will still be a new experience for a man so used to the routines, training and tactics of a 400m track.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The Briton insists he is excited about taking on a new challenge after those hard months away from his family running up to 150 miles a week on the dirt tracks of Kenya’s Rift Valley, but he is still not the bookmakers’ favourite, despite home advantage. Wilson Kipsang, the world record holder, claimed Farah was ‘not a big threat’ this week but he, too, conceded we do not really know his capabilities.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar, has advised the 31-year-old not to follow the near world-record pace expected to be set by Haile Gebrselassie, who will take the leading pack to the halfway mark in around 58 minutes. </font></p>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Ready and willing: Mo Farah insists he is not risking his reputation by taking on the London Marathon\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"437\" id=\"i-aed50e98\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1CEFE82200000578-468_634x437.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Ready and willing: Mo Farah insists he is not risking his reputation by taking on the London Marathon</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Seeing stars: The long distance runner collapsed at the end of the New York half marathon in March\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"432\" id=\"i-ad8e0e8c\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1C591BAE00000578-763_634x432.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Seeing stars: The long distance runner collapsed at the end of the New York half marathon in March</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Up for it: Double Olympic champion Farah poses in front of Tower Bridge to promote the London marathon\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"454\" id=\"i-b0f30ea7\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1CEFAAE400000578-620_634x454.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Up for it: Double Olympic champion Farah poses in front of Tower Bridge to promote the London marathon</p> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Instead, Farah will run about 30 seconds slower, ready to attack in the second half of the race. Patience will be crucial. If he goes off too quickly his race could be over before it has begun.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">More realistic success for Farah on his debut would be to break Steve Jones’s 1985 British record of 2hr 7min 13sec to add to the national marks he already holds at 1500m, 5,000m, 10,000m and the half-marathon. To be Britain’s best over so many distances  would be a phenomenal achievement, after all.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Jones, now 58, expressed sadness that his record looks set to go but was surprised it had stood for nearly 29 years. His mark belongs to a different era  — Jones drank 10 pints of cider at a wedding the night before setting a new world half- marathon best in Birmingham in 1984.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">‘Mo and I are miles apart, but I ran with no fear and I can’t see why Mo would have any fear,’ he said.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">‘I’m just a journeyman compared with him.</font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">‘It wouldn’t be a surprise if he shattered the British record. It wouldn’t surprise me if he won the race. He’s going to go down as one of the great British runners of all time.’ </font><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Farah’s place in such prestigious company is assured, but there should be no sense of disappointment or failure if he does not become the first British male winner since Eamonn Martin in 1993. Should he break Jones’s British record, that accolade can wait for another year.</font></p>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"On the run: Farah will be the star attraction at the London marathon later this month\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"445\" id=\"i-aecd0e91\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1CEFC84900000578-320_634x445.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">On the run: Farah will be the star attraction at the London marathon later this month</p> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Stepping up: Farah, pictured during the New York half marathon, will be doubling his distance in London\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"491\" id=\"i-aa5a0e6d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1C57406F00000578-232_634x491.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Stepping up: Farah, pictured during the New York half marathon, will be doubling his distance in London</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Defiant: Farah insists his collapse in New York has not affected his preparations for the London marathon\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"367\" id=\"i-ac3f0e88\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/08/article-2599813-1CF002F400000578-899_634x367.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Defiant: Farah insists his collapse in New York has not affected his preparations for the London marathon</p> </div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div>\n<div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/othersports/article-2599074/Bekele-throws-gauntlet-Farahs-big-rival-sends-message-Paris-win.html\"> Bekele throws down the gauntlet as Farah\'s big rival sends out message with Paris win</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/othersports/article-2599813/Mo-Farah-gunning-British-record-London-marathon-collapse-New-York.html\"> Farah gunning for British record at London marathon after collapse in New York</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/othersports/article-2580489/Mo-Farahs-Commonwealth-plans-depend-fares-Glasgow-dress-rehearsal.html\"> Farah\'s Commonwealth plans depend on how he fares in Glasgow dress rehearsal</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/othersports/article-2582066/Farah-collapses-end-New-York-half-marathon.html\"> Farah taken away in wheelchair after collapsing at the end of the New York half marathon</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/othersports/article-2573314/Mo-Farah-race-Glasgow-Diamond-League-meeting.html\"> Farah set for Glasgow... but for Diamond League (not Commonwealth Games)</a></li> </ul> </div>\n<font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"> </font>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"column-content cleared\"> <div class=\"shareArticles\"> <h3 class=\"social-links-title\">Share or comment on this article</h3> <div class=\"social-links cleared\" id=\"socialLinks\"> <ul class=\"bigLinks sc-icns cleared\"> <li class=\"facebook\"> <a class=\"js-tl\" onclick=\'postToFB(\"bottom\");

With goal average taking precedence over goal difference, Huddersfield Town secured a 1-1 draw against Forest to pip Cardiff City to the post by 0.024 goals. 1962 Ipswich v Aston Villa In 1957, Ipswich Town were in the Third Division South of the Football League. Just five years later, a miraculous period under Alf Ramsey left them one result away from the League title. A 2-0 victory completed arguably the greatest rise in the history of the game.  Jubilation: Ipswich fans and players celebrate Ray Crawford\'s opening goal to set them on the way to the title  1968 Man City v Newcastle Forty-four years before City’s 2012 heroics, exactly the same happened. Manchester United went to Sunderland, knowing a win would grant them the championship. Their 2-1 defeat, though, ensured City’s 4-3 win at Newcastle was enough to turn Manchester sky-blue for a season at least.  Raise a toast: City players celebrate the 1968 title win - top row (L-R) Glyn Pardoe, George Heslop, Alan Oakes, Colin Bell, Francis Lee - bottom row (L-R) Tony Book, Mike Doyle, Ken Mulhearn  1972 Leeds v Wolves With the top four separated by a single point, Leeds travelled to Molineux on the final day needing just a draw to be crowned champions. However, in a game now infamous for an attempted case of match-fixing, Wolves beat them 2-1, gifting the title to Brian Clough’s Derby County.   More... Stop Toure and you stop City!

The Gunners led 1-0 until the final minute, when Michael Thomas broke free and, with virtually the last kick, dinked the ball over Bruce Grobbelaar to secure a first title in 18 years.  Iconic: Michael Thomas hits home past Bruce Grobbelaar to hand Arsenal the title at Anfield in 1989  2002 Man Utd v Arsenal As the Ferguson/Wenger rivalry reached its peak, Arsenal strode into enemy territory to secure a League and FA Cup Double. Sylvain Wiltord marked his 100th Arsenal appearance with a first-time finish for the title.  Wide open: Sylvain Wiltord\'s goal for Arsenal at Old Trafford in 2002 went down in Gunners folklore  2012 Man City v QPR Sergio Aguero\'s 94th-minute winner — after Edin Dzeko’s injury-time goal — saw them come back to beat QPR 3-2, and secure a first title in 44 years, made all the sweeter for being nicked from their fiercest and nearest rivals.

They have become the first club in the Premier League to sell, on a regular basis, signed shirts worn by the players this season in their official online store — advertised as a chance for fans to ‘own a piece of LFC History’... at a price. Shirts, autographed after the game, cost £1,000 and players with kit on sale include Lucas, Jordan Henderson, Simon Mignolet, Raheem Sterling, Joe Allen, Aly Cissokho and Jon Flanagan.  Sold out! Luis Suarez\'s signed shirt comes at the price of £3,000 - the most expensive in the squad  Jerseys worn by Luis Suarez, priced at £3,000, captain Steven Gerrard, £2,000, and Daniel  Sturridge, £1,000, are already sold out. A club spokesman said Liverpool do not sell shirts for commercial gain when there’s a charity connection on the strip like the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough being worn for tomorrow’s crucial game against Manchester City.  Premier League basement clubs are still upset over Sunderland escaping with a fine rather than a points deduction for fielding the ineligible Ji Dong-won in four games.  Controversy: Sunderland were fined after Ji Dong-won features in four games as an ineligible player  Their anger  now extends to them wanting to know the role, if any, of the Premier League director of governance Jane Purdon. Solicitor Purdon is a lifelong Sunderland fan and was their club secretary for four years until she joined the PL in 2005. The PL, annoyed about any questioning of Purdon’s undoubted integrity, say the issue was dealt with by general secretary Nic Coward and the PL board.  Hull City owner Assem Allam will take his top-table place in the VIP Wembley Suite tomorrow before the FA Cup semi-final against Sheffield United, despite the FA blocking his name change. The Hull hierarchy are planning to forget the FA council rejecting the switch to the Tigers at their meeting last Wednesday, at least for the duration of their Wembley trip.  More...

It is not known which way Spurs’ director of administration Eales voted or whether he abstained. But many of the professional game representatives on the FA were sympathetic to the wishes of Allam, who has invested as much as £74m in his football team. Chelsea’s board refused to sit with the FA in 2012 in protest at the late Cup semi-final kick-off three days before their Champions League semi-final. ......................................................................... Radio 5 Live rugby correspondent Ian Robertson was questioned about an armed robbery in London. The number plate from Robertson’s 500cc midnight blue Piaggio motor bike was caught on CCTV cameras at the scene of a crime.   However, Robertson had a cast-iron alibi as he was commentating on the Newcastle v Worcester Premiership game, having parked his heavily padlocked bike at King’s Cross railway station. Thieves left the bike itself but stole the plates. Robertson said: ‘The police quickly ruled me out of their list of suspects.’  League check on Price The Football League might have failed to keep Italian Massimo Cellino out of Leeds following his successful appeal after failing their owners and directors test.  Fit and proper? The Football League failed to keep Massimo Cellino (R) taking over Leeds  But the FL are continuing their vigilance against the last high-profile fit-and-proper failure, Jim Price, agent of axed  Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies. The FL have written to Forest wanting confirmation Price is no longer involved at the City Ground.  Manager Roy Hodgson has described the interest in the England team’s wives and girlfriends as a ‘media obsession’ ever since the circus that surrounded their 2006 antics in Baden-Baden.  Circus: England football WAGs became notorious after their antics in Baden-Baden at the 2006 World Cup   However, Hodgson, in a well received address to the FA council this week about his preparations for Brazil, devoted a chunk of his talk about what he’s doing with the WAGs.  The brain drain from Times Sport into the headhunters business continues with former Olympic correspondent Ashling O’Connor  joining former rugby correspondent Mark Souster at Inzito, set up by another former Times correspondent, Carol Leonard.

Munyai is ranked in the top 10 with the WBA and steps in at short notice for the fight at the Manchester Arena. The 28-year-old from South Africa has enjoyed success in England before, having won the Commonwealth bantamweight crown in London against Martin Power in 2006, defending it four months later against Lee Haskins and then defeating Power again in a rematch for the title the following year.

Scott is in fantastic shape and ready to make a big statement as we eye unification fights this summer.’ Defence: Scott Quigg won the super-bantamweight world title at the beginning of October Points: Despite a slow start against Yoandris Salinas, Quigg did enough to win the title Quigg’s title defence tops an exciting night of boxing in Manchester, with chief-support in the shape of a lightweight derby between Anthony Crolla and John Murray.

City take on Premier League leaders Liverpool intent on tilting the title race back in their favour but will face an impassioned cauldron of a stadium as both clubs commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. Respectful of the occasion but mindful of the game’s importance, Pellegrini said: ‘It will be a very emotional day but the team that has the cold mind will win the game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini and Brendan Rodgers talk ahead of the clash  All set: Sergio Aguero trains on Friday at Carrington ahead of Sunday\'s title showdown with Liverpool Chat: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has a few words with striker Aguero during training Pellegrini: Liverpool game is no more important than any other  LIVERPOOL WIN THE TREBLE!Rodgers, Gerrard and Suarez scoop awards ‘It is easy in these big games to have the motivation but it is very important to manage the anxiety. \'That is very important for all the players. With an excess of anxiety you can make more mistakes. It will be decided by one or two goals. So it’s very important to have control of your minds in these moments.’ Liverpool are chasing their first league title in 24 years while City are still seen as favourites yet Pellegrini does not buy into the mantra that counterpart Brendan Rodgers is under less pressure to deliver. ‘I can’t imagine that the Liverpool manager does not have pressure to win the title,’ he said. ‘I think every manager or every team that has big players and that spends money to win the title has the same pressure every year. \'I can’t believe such an important team as Liverpool, the manager has no pressure to win the title. I think everyone who manages Liverpool has that pressure. Liverpool are favourites because they are top of the table.’ Tickets are changing hands for more than £3,000 apiece on the black market such is the demand, yet Pellegrini, who welcomes back fit-again striker Sergio Aguero, insists the game will not decide the Premier League winners. ‘This is a very important game but it is not a title decider. Of course, the team that wins this game has more chance because they have three points more but if you think that with this you finish the Premier League, it is a mistake. Going to ground: Aguero makes a slide tackle as he gets ready to return in Sunday\'s match Warming up: City players jog around the pitch as they get the training session underway on Friday Rodgers: We will unleash the Liverpool supporters on Man City   ‘Really, we have two games in hand but we do not have six points. We have to play those two games. \'That is why I say it is very important to win at Liverpool but if we think by winning at Liverpool we win the Premier League, I don’t think so because after Sunday we have to play on Wednesday against Sunderland who are in a relegation position and those teams are as difficult as Liverpool. ‘Just one point will decide the title. The pressure is the same for both teams, and for Chelsea also. Three teams will fight for it until the last day.’ Pellegrini insists he has no regrets about not becoming Liverpool manager despite holding talks prior to their appointment of Roy Hodgson in 2010. ‘After I finished with Real Madrid I had a conversation with Liverpool,’ he confirmed. ‘It’s in the past not the future. \'I have no regrets about not taking Liverpool job because it gave me the chance to work at Manchester City. No regrets about that.’ .

But in a difference of footballing opinion with the current regime, led by sporting director Txiki Begiristain, Sellars has had his employment terminated.

The impending 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster provides a tragic backdrop to Sunday’s clash, meaning the atmosphere inside Anfield will take on a different intensity; both clubs will pay tribute to the 96 Liverpool fans who died on April 15, 1989. It will not, however, be a purely sombre occasion. Liverpool’s chance of winning the title will be significantly enhanced if they record a first win over City in the Premier League since April 11, 2011 and Rodgers wants to use every possible avenue to help his side.

Rodgers, who was named Manager of the Month for March, said: ‘I think our players will feed off it. We will pay our commemoration before the game; the (Memorial) Service on Tuesday is going to be where the raw emotion comes out. ‘Our job is to provide a lift to the supporters, families and victims in terms of our performance. We embrace that. It (expectation) is not something that’s going to sabotage our work. It will help us grow and help our responsibility. We know what that is. Hopefully we can use that to good effect.’ At the end of Liverpool’s last home game, the 4-0 dismantling of Tottenham, the Kop let out a spontaneous roar that struck a chord with Rodgers and his squad and he is adamant the hoem crowd are capable of influencing results. ‘I’ve sensed it myself, the roar is different,’ said Rodgers. ‘Anfield is a different place from the drive up now. Growing up as a kid and I remember watching on the TV and seeing the bloom of Anfield, there’s a touch of that now. The supporters are really the ones that will push us over the line.

I remember going back and the players and manager (Jose Mourinho) even said the supporters won the game. \'That’s the beauty of Anfield. It’s an iconic ground and for us it’s so important in our destiny.’ There is no sense from the way Liverpool have been training that they are feeling the strain of trying to win a first title since 1990 and midfielder Philippe Coutinho feels the pressure is squarely on the shoulders of City. Home: Liverpool players will be hope they have a result to celebrate at Anfield on Sunday   Plotting: Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard worked for 30 minutes on free-kicks at Melwood   Burst a valve: The manager and his captain are particular about how the ball is placed before it\'s struck ‘We are not thinking about pressure or external factors in these last five matches,’ he said. ‘We know that City are considered one of the favourites from the start but Brendan tells us to forget the excitement, the expectations and not to worry about anything that\'s happening around us.’ Luis Suarez added: ‘Our target was to finish in the top four and we\'ve won our last few games. \'We also know Chelsea and City dropped some points, so we\'re at the top of the league now and that\'s amazing for us. Now we can\'t stop because we have a really good chance.’ Rodgers: We will unleash the Liverpool supporters on Man City Ready to roll: Suarez and Rodgers watch on as Gerrard hits a stationary ball      More...

I just fell to my knees and started punching the ground. ‘We didn’t have a lot of goals in that team, but we were solid and we gave ourselves a great opportunity by keeping it scoreless and taking it to penalties.

After Curtis Davies leads Hull City out at Wembley tomorrow afternoon, his every header and tackle will be monitored in a quiet corner of West Africa. Davies is of Sierra Leonean descent, and if Sheffield United are kept at bay by his resolute defending, they will be cheering thousands of miles away.

London-born of a Sierra Leonean father, the  29-year-old hopes England manager Roy Hodgson may also tune in but is beginning to lose hope of making Brazil this summer. With a Republic of Ireland call-up looking unlikely, due to tenuous links and a broadside from Roy Keane, his relatives on Africa’s Atlantic coast could even soon be celebrating him playing for Sierra Leone.

Blades run: Only League One underdogs Sheffield United stand between Hull and the final  Clough: Hull fans may be saving themselves for the final, we... ‘Only the Cup could do that. There could be quite a crowd watching over there; Liam Rosenior’s family are from Sierra Leone. ‘You wonder whether Wembley could be a stage for pressing England claims, but, then again, Roy Hodgson said if you haven’t been in one of the squads by now, there is only a slim chance you’ll make the World Cup. It looks like the only way I’ll get close is if there are massive injury problems. ‘As for Ireland, I had a  pint of Guinness once! What can I say? My nan was born in Ireland, but she’s not Irish. She’s English. Her father was in the army and he was in Ireland when she was born. So I qualify, but there’s no heritage.  Ship has sailed: Davies accepts he is unlikely to feature in England boss Roy Hodgson\'s World Cup squad  ‘Anyway, Roy Keane made it clear he didn’t think I was good enough, when he was asked recently, and it has been well documented that Martin O’Neill and I had problems at Villa. So that would be a great managerial duo for me! ‘I’d never shut the door on anything, but I’m striving my heart out to try to get in the England squad and, after that, Sierra Leone is my next country. It’d be difficult with commitments like the Africa Cup of Nations. I can just imagine how that would go down with the gaffer (Steve Bruce) if I disappeared for a few weeks in January, but that would be the next option for me.’  Not fans! Neither Martin O\'Neill (L) or Roy Keane are likely to give the Hull defender a call-up for Ireland  Davies should have been involved in the first ever game at the rebuilt Wembley but was injured. ‘It was an England Under 21 game. I was told I would partner Anton Ferdinand in the centre of defence. I was really excited, but a week before the game, I got a painful knock on the foot. I had a scan and it was a broken metatarsal.

It\'s an impossible question to answer, of course. But perhaps the fate of America\'s Mid-Amateur champion Mike McCoy offers a clue. Now McCoy is no decent club golfer. He\'s a brilliant club golfer.  Hard yards: Michael McCoy followed up an 78 with an 83 in the second round  In fact, the 51-year-old insurance executive from Des Moines is the greatest amateur golfer the state of Iowa has ever produced. McCoy is an 11-time Iowa amateur player of the year and five-time Iowa amateur champion. To get here, McCoy prevailed from an original entry of 4,238 players for the Mid-Amateur Championship to claim the Bob Jones Memorial Trophy, named after the greatest amateur of all and the founder of the Masters. Make no mistake, our friend from Iowa is very much the real McCoy. So how did he shape up against such daunting yardage and flag positions so precarious they look like they might fall off the ledges they\'re perched upon?  Dream ticket: Amateur McCoy had resolved to enjoy every moment of Masters experience  Poor McCoy had resolved to enjoy every minute of his once-in-a-lifetime experience. But how can a man so accustomed to shooting in the sixties enjoy what happened on Friday? After opening with a 78, he had the satisfaction at least of seeing a couple of former champions - albeit now in their 60s - in Ben Crenshaw and Craig Stadler below him on the leaderboard, not to mention a current star in Luke Donald. What happened on day two?  Experience: British Amateur champion Garrick Porteous carded an eight over par 80  McCoy shot 44 for the front nine, notionally what a 16-handicapper is supposed to shoot. He finished with an 83. \'My body just wouldn\'t respond to what my brain was telling it to do,\' he sighed. He was not alone. Garrick Porteous, the 24-year-old British Amateur champion at the other end of the age scale, will turn pro on Saturday having signed off with an 80. What would a decent club golfer shoot?

VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admit Cardiff need a miracle  Living on a prayer: Vincent Tan has accused former director Iain Moody of trying to find out Cardiff team news   Six-pointer: Crystal Palace beat Cardiff 3-0 to move seven points clear of the relegation zone  More... Cardiff sack member of staff over Palace spying scandal after check of phone records All the Premier League and FA Cup team news and stats ahead of the weekend Nine of the top ten players in the Premier League distance covered table are English... but which star is the top-flight\'s marathon man? Caulker urges internal inquiry into leak after concerns over early release of team news Palace accused of SPYING on Cardiff before 3-0 win as Premier League investigate Tan claims Cardiff have reported their suspicions to the Premier League and Sportsmail can reveal that the allegations also include an assertion that Moody contacted at least three individuals at the club between Wednesday and Friday of last week, asking for information about the team. A prominent Cardiff source has told us that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made aware of what was going on when a message sent from Moody’s phone, listing the starting 11 against Palace, was received by a Cardiff employee. The employee tipped off Solskjaer, who reported the matter to the club hierarchy, but the Norwegian did not change his team. Moody and Palace have strenuously denied they attempted to obtain team information from anyone at Cardiff. Cardiff have not complained formally to the  Premier League, but chairman Mehmet Dalman has handed over a dossier and requested the incident be reviewed. The dossier has been built around what the source calls ‘real evidence’, including the phone records of staff who would have had access to the information that was leaked, and text messages from Moody, who was sacked by owner Vincent Tan last year. Solskjaer: We now need a miracle but I\'m full of fight   Solskjaer referred all matters relating to the incident to Dalman, but he did not wish to comment.Solskjaer raised eyebrows after the Palace defeat by indicating there was a lack of ‘loyalty’ among some elements of the dressing room, though he said it related to players following his instructions. On Saturday he said: ‘I have no reason to doubt any of my players’ professionality (sic), honesty, integrity or loyalty. I have said what I have said and the rest will come from Mehmet. I have just answered the question and how many times have I got to tell you?’ Responding to the allegations on Thursday, Moody said: ‘I don’t think I have done anything wrong. That is incredibly, extraordinarily untrue. That is untrue, completely untrue.’ While he strongly denied  contacting anyone at Cardiff to try to elicit information, he did admit to using wider contacts in the game, as is standard practice.  Clear conscience: Iain Moody (centre) and Crystal Palace have denied all allegations made by Tan ‘That is the whole point of what we do as scouts,’ he added Cardiff captain Steve Caulker said yesterday: ‘To be honest with you, there have been problems like that all season, where certain things have been leaked. ‘It is frustrating. We need to focus on getting things right on the pitch, not what’s going on off the pitch. I will be telling the boys that we need to get performances in and get results, not concern  ourselves with off-the-field issues. ‘It has obviously come from somewhere. That’s down to the gaffer (Solskjaer) and the staff above him to sort out, and we can just focus on playing football. ‘A lot of stuff has been going on off the pitch all season, and that has been highlighted in the press. It is important we all ignore all that stuff. Our performances have not been up to scratch of late.’   More...

Shinji Kagawa is one player understood to be fighting for his future at the club.  There have been very few genuine high points in what has been a disastrous first season at Manchester United for David Moyes, but one common denominator in almost every performance of note has been the involvement of Shinji Kagawa. The Japanese playmaker has been widely tipped to be part of the expected summer exodus from Old Trafford, and to a certain extent that\'s understandable - there\'s no denying that the 25 year-old has yet to reproduce the sort of form that lit up the Bundesliga during his time with Borussia Dortmund, and under Moyes he has started just 19 of the club\'s 50 matches thus far this term. VIDEO Scroll down to watch funny videos of Shinji Kagawa  On the ball: Shinji Kagawa (right) in action against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday   Rare sighting: The Japan playmaker has found his chances limited at Old Trafford this season  Mitigating factors abound, however. Sir Alex Ferguson\'s opportunistic signing of Robin van Persie and Moyes\' general unwillingness to look beyond partnering the Dutchman with Wayne Rooney have seen Kagawa largely utilised out of position on the left wing. Perhaps even more crucially, the laboured, plodding football United have played this season has been the very antithesis of the fluid, creative, high-tempo setup on which he thrived at Dortmund. Starved of possession and ignored when taking up clever positions, it can be little surprise that Kagawa has often struggled to influence. Until recent weeks, that is. With Van Persie sidelined and Rooney pushed forward into the centre-forward role most consider to be his best, United have produced some of their best football all season. Kagawa has still nominally been deployed in a left-sided role, but now alongside a genuine, inventive No 10 in Juan Mata, on whom he can rely to get him the ball in the parts of the pitch where he can really do damage. Shinji Kagawa takes on samurais and wins  Promising: Kagawa and Juan Mata (right, also with Javier Hernandez) linked well in the win at Newcastle   Why does it always rain on me? 10 United players are facing the exit in a summer clearout, including Kagawa    More... Welbeck and Cleverley pictured dancing in the street... hours after returning from United\'s Champions League exit Moyes faces uncertain future... with up to 10 United stars heading for Old Trafford exit Everton would be nowhere near Champions League without loan stars like Lukaku... but where would your side be in the table? Nine of the top ten players in the Premier League distance covered table are English... but which star is the top-flight\'s marathon man? All the Premier League and FA Cup team news and stats ahead of the weekend Glum United arrive home after Munich failure as Fletcher warns they still have plenty to play for with futures on the line Kagawa\'s late introduction at The Hawthorns saw a marked change in United\'s style of play, and he was integral to the Reds\' comeback against Aston Villa, with two sublime first-half passes leading directly to goals. The interplay between Kagawa, Mata and Adnan Januzaj against Newcastle was an absolute joy, and if allowed to continue, it\'s only a matter of time before the Japanese follows the latter pair onto the scoresheet with regularity - his goal return in the Bundesliga is ample proof of that. Recent big games have seen Moyes revert somewhat to the more one-dimensional norm for this season, and if that is continues to be the case we may never see the best of Kagawa in a United shirt. Kagawa stars with dog and dolphins in new advert   Tough choices: United manager David Moyes (second left) must make some big decisions over his squad  Shift: Wayne Rooney\'s move into the centre-forward position could make room for Kagawa in the side  If, however, the manager has learnt anything from the quality of football produced in the lesser games of late, it is absolutely imperative that the Japanese is not just kept on but made integral to the club\'s plans moving forward.

With British Cycling based in Manchester and Team Sky’s main training headquarters now in Nice, it was like asking Jose Mourinho to take on Chelsea without relinquishing control of Real Madrid. So on Friday, after a 10-year reign that had brought eight gold medals at both the London and Beijing Olympics in 2008, Brailsford stood down as performance director of British Cycling to focus on running the Team Sky road team.  Quit: Sir Dave Brailsford has resigned as performance director of British Cycling to focus on Team Sky  Brailsford made it clear before the recent Track World Championships that it was becoming too much — that he was being spread too thin and that both teams could suffer as a consequence. For a man who sets the highest of standards, whose mantra is ‘marginal gains’, and has an acute attention to detail, a  situation that meant he might be giving less than his best was unacceptable.He hopes the British Cycling team he has put in place will continue to achieve success, not least at the Rio Games in 2016. ‘It just feels like it’s a natural transition,’ Brailsford said yesterday. ‘We’ve thought for a long time as to how we can get British Cycling in the best possible shape and give the riders the best possible support going into Rio, because that’s the most important thing. Chat: Brailsford speaks to Chris Froome as the Brit rides to victory at the 2013 Tour de France   ‘It’s been well documented that my time is more stretched across Team Sky and British Cycling. Team Sky have grown with the success of the Tour de France and I felt that the back-up that now exists at British Cycling — with Ian Drake as CEO, with Shane Sutton knowing all the riders — it’s the right team to move that team on.’ For some of the riders, Brailsford’s departure might be as unsettling as it was for Manchester United’s players when Sir Alex Ferguson retired. To add to their woes is the departure of Dr Steve Peters, the acclaimed psychiatrist to whom  Sir Chris Hoy, Sir Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton have said they owe much of their success. Those who remain can only hope a healthy degree of continuity will ensure there is further success.A major reshuffle sees Sutton promoted to British Cycling’s technical director with responsibility for rider performance. Andy Harrison will continue as programmes director. Both report to Drake but a new role — head of performance support — has also been created. Having left Team Sky as sporting director to join the Premier League youth department as head of elite performance, it is thought Dan Hunt could return to cycling from football. Peters, recruited by England manager Roy Hodgson after his success with Liverpool, will step down but will remain with Brailsford at Team Sky. Before he departs he will assist in setting up a new support system for riders. Mastermind: Brailsford celebrates Victoria Pendleton\'s gold medal in the keirin at London 2012 ‘I want to thank Sir Dave Brailsford for his enormous contribution to British Cycling,’ said Drake. ‘The organisation he leaves behind is transformed from the one we both joined in 1998. ‘I’m confident we have the right management team to take us into Rio and beyond. Cycling in this country has travelled a long way but the best is yet to come.’ Brailsford insisted he will remain close to British Cycling. Success: Brailsford poses with 2012 Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins (left), and receives his knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in February 2013    ‘I’ll still be available to Ian, Shane and Andy for support and my role at Team Sky will mean we’ll still work closely and support the aims of British Cycling,’ he said. ‘I’ve spent the past week sitting down with every rider who is going to Rio. We have a fantastically  talented group of very young,  brilliantly enthusiastic riders. The talent is there, the support network is there and sometimes you just need to freshen things up. ‘This will help that group going forward. I’ve got no concerns at all that they’ll move on to bigger things and Rio will be fantastic for them.’ FIVE OF BRAILSFORD\'S BESTSir Dave Brailsford on Friday stood down as British Cycling performance director after a decade of unprecedented success.BEIJING BOUNTYIt began with Nicole Cooke in torrential rain, storming to gold in the women\'s road race by the Great Wall of China. There followed a display of dominance in the velodrome few thought could ever be repeated. In 10 events, Britain won seven, including three gold medals for Sir Chris Hoy. The remarkable thing is Britain\'s cyclists matched the feat in London four years later.TEAM PURSUIT TYROSThe four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit, perhaps more than any other discipline, occupied Brailsford\'s attention and provided the greatest demonstration of Britain\'s dominance at the Laoshan Velodrome in Beijing. Ed Clancy, Paul Manning, Geraint Thomas and Bradley Wiggins won in scintillating fashion, nearly seven seconds ahead of their nearest rivals, in posting a world record which stood for four years.UNION FLAGS AT THE TOUR DE FRANCEIt was not all glory and gold for Brailsford. Team Sky\'s first Tour de France in 2010 was a failure, with Wiggins underperforming from the start in Rotterdam. But the roadside support of British riders in a British team galvanised Brailsford, ever the enthusiast, and encouraged him that the Team Sky project was the right one to pursue. Three years later, two British Team Sky riders had won the sport\'s greatest race.WIGGINS SEIZING YELLOWFor Brailsford, the seventh stage of the 2012 Tour de France to La Planche des Belles Filles, won by Chris Froome as Sir Bradley Wiggins took the race lead, \"couldn\'t have been more perfect\". He said: \"There was a brow (of a hill), beautiful blue sky behind it, and all you could see was Froomie\'s helmet coming up like a helicopter. That was one of the highlights of my career. That stage will stay with me forever.\"HOY\'S FINAL STANDHoy, winner of gold in Athens and three more in Beijing, had seen it all in the velodrome and bowed out after winning the Keirin at London 2012. He won his sixth gold and Britain\'s eighth of London 2012 on the final day of the track programme. Laura Trott, Jason Kenny and others showed the next generation had arrived, but Hoy\'s final flourish proved to be a glorious Olympic hurrah for Brailsford.    More...

Cruiserweight Conquest, who won the belt in a brutal battle against Daniel Ammann in February, takes on McKenzie at the Copper Box Arena on Saturday. The Romford ace knows he’ll have to be at his best against the two-time Commonwealth champion at light-heavyweight who gave Enzo Maccarinelli a tough fight last time before being stopped in the 11th round.  Contender: Ovil McKenzie (left) will be a stern test to Tony Conquest\'s title defence    ‘If you’re a champion you can’t pick and choose who you’re gonna fight. Eventually you’re going to have to fight good men,’ said Conquest. ‘I’d rather fight someone who gives me that little bit of fear in my belly because I know I have to fight and it makes be better. ‘When I boxed Wadi Camacho I knew he was a terrific puncher and a big old lump. That gave me the added little bit of incentive and the adrenalin was pumping. ‘If you look at his body, Ovill’s legs aren’t that big but his upper body is like a cruiserweight. He is the complete polar opposite of me.  Conquest defeated Wadi Camacho at the O2 Arena in October   Take that: Conquest lands a punch on Camacho in an epic battle  ‘There is a big jump from light-heavyweight to cruiserweight but he’s beaten big lumps like Buster Keaton and Terry Dunstan. Ovill got his tactics right against them and showed he isn’t just a big puncher, but also has a bit of a brain. ‘I will have to be right on the ball. ‘He is dangerous all the time, and I will have to be on my guard especially early on when he has won before. ‘Ovill does get a little bit tired, but when you look how much muscle there is on him he’s gonna get a little bit tire.‘The first six rounds is when he’ll be at his most dangerous and I’m expecting to come in stronger than ever because he hasn’t got any weight troubles.’ Frank Buglioni, Bradley Skeete and Lewis Pettitt are also in action at the Olympic venue in London.Tony Conquest vs Ovill McKenzie is live on Box Nation on Saturday.

I thought he was terrific. I was the director of sport for the British Olympic Association and my first call on the first day in the job was from the cycling performance director.

If the answer was ‘no’, he wouldn’t accept it. He knew what I had achieved in sport and wanted to see if he could tap into it. You see the gold medals, the lycra and the glamour of cycling, but he created a tough regime, taking no prisoners. In fact, he created the toughest environment I’ve witnessed outside the England rugby set-up — for men and women. He called it marginal gains. He thought it was all so obvious, but he would break it down to this simple message: ‘Do everything better than anyone else.’ You can’t do that without leadership — and success starts at the top. His biggest success has been the performance of Team Sky in the Tour de France. His Olympic golds were amazing, but the Tour success made me say ‘wow’. People said he couldn’t do it, but he is not a man to accept failure. Success in professional sport is about outstanding athletes, but also about outstanding coaching.

Four months after motor sport\'s world governing body called for new entrants to compete in the sport, Haas has been accepted following a period of due diligence. Haas said in a statement: \'Obviously, we\'re extremely pleased to have been granted a Formula One licence by the FIA.

It\'s a challenge we embrace as we work to put cars on the grid. \'I want to thank the FIA for this opportunity and the diligence everyone put forth to see our licence application come to fruition.\' Haas at least has motor sport running through his veins as he forms one half of the successful Stewart-Haas Racing team based in Kannapolis, North Carolina.  Champagne moment: Lewis Hamilton celebrates winning the Bahrain Grand Prix last Sunday  F1 Grid: The teams in 2014 Red Bull RacingMercedesFerrariLotusMcLarenForce India Toro Rosso SauberWilliams Martini Racing Catheram Marussia Haas certainly has the credentials and capability to get a new team up and running as he owns factory facilities in Brussels which would likely be key for a European base. Haas also runs the full-scale Windshear rolling-road wind tunnel in North Carolina that has previously been used by a number of Formula One teams, although that facility is understood to be banned at present. Former Red Bull and Jaguar technical director Guenther Steiner is working with Haas on the project. America last tried to get a team on the grid in 2010 at a time when F1 was seeking significant expansion, only for US F1\'s plans to fail to come to fruition. Haas still has numerous hurdles to overcome, notably with regard to cost as F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has warned one billion dollars (£600million) would likely last him four years. Haas is entering at a time when the major marques have put a block on FIA president Jean Todt\'s plans for a cost cap to be introduced from next year. Financial control will instead supposedly come through a tightening of the technical and sporting regulations. Haas will also certainly be all too aware that since the last three new teams were accepted from 2010, Hispania Racing no longer exists, whilst Marussia and Caterham have failed to score a point in 80 races to date despite the fact the top 10 cars now score points.

The South Africa-based businessman has urged fans to follow through on a plan to withhold season ticket money – and also starve the club hierarchy of other commercial income. His searing attack follows the launch earlier this week of season ticket renewals, despite chief executive Graham Wallace’s 120-day business review not yet being released. The 59-year-old believes there has been a breach of an agreement reached last month when, following talks between the two sides, King agreed to delay his plans until the board had produced a plan for the club’s future.

The Rangers board responded by strongly refuting all of King’s accusations – branding them ‘disgraceful’ – and said they could consider legal action. The Ibrox directors insisted King had misrepresented their position, stating the review would appear before the season ticket renewal deadline on May 6. While the war of words rages on anew, King will now press ahead with his fan-led revolution. And he has gained the backing of nine-in-a-row captain Richard Gough, who will act as a custodian of the trust account being activated to keep supporter cash out of the board’s reach until specific conditions are met. Speaking of his talks last month, King said: ‘The board recommitted to issue the business review within the original 120 day deadline and, importantly, committed that the fans will have access to this review prior to advancing funds by way of season ticket renewals.  Rangers Chairman David Somers (front, left) is accused of reneging on a promise to supporters‘Despite strong reservations from fan groups I asked the fans to give the board time to honour this commitment. ‘Part of my motivation was that any public company board is bound to act in good faith and that breach of such a share price sensitive commitment would be an ethical, moral, and probably criminal breach.  ‘I followed up on this commitment with the board after the recent announcement on season ticket renewals. The Chairman has advised me that the board will now only issue the review at the end of the season ticket renewal period and it will consequently not be timeously made available to fans. Disturbingly, the Chairman has advised me that the true intention of the board had always been to delay issuing the review until funds had been largely collected. ‘I apologise to all fans for wasting time by lending credibility to the board’s false representations. I was wrong to give them the benefit of the doubt.’ The timing of King’s statement is controversial, given that it came on the eve of Saturday\'s crucial Scottish Cup semi-final against Dundee United. It’s understood he felt he had no option but to break cover again after the formal launch of season ticket renewals on Wednesday. King has stated his intention to provide at least £30 million of the £50 million he feels it will take to restore Rangers over the next four years, but wants to do so via a new share issue that would dilute the current power base.If enough fans rally behind his plan, it could force the board to either agree to his wish or risk the club suffer another insolvency event.‘It is common cause that the club is not a going concern without access to the season ticket loan from the fans,’ said King. ‘It is also common cause that the season ticket money will only provide partial relief in advance of a more permanent recapitalisation. ‘I have hitherto urged restraint in dealing with the board, however due to this extreme act of bad faith I believe that it is vital that fans now withhold season ticket money from this board and similarly refuse to support the club by way of the purchase of replica kit or any other retail product.  ‘An announcement will shortly be made providing details of a bank account that season ticket money can be paid into as an interim measure.   Dejected: Rangers players after their cup final defeat against Raith Rovers  The specific terms and conditions of this account will be made available to fans, including the basis on which funds will be advanced to the club and the basis on which funds will be returned to fans. As a minimum, the board must provide the club property as security against the season ticket money. ‘I recognise that fans will have anxiety about “betraying” the club and the risk of loss of a cherished seat at Ibrox.  However, the time has come when the trade-off is a potential loss of a seat against the loss of the club. That would be the real betrayal. This board has lost its right to be dealt with on a good faith basis.’ King’s words provoked an equally stern response from within the Ibrox boardroom. ‘The Chairman and the Board refute all such allegations in the strongest terms and have referred Mr King’s statement to the Club’s legal advisors,’ said their statement. ‘Mr King clearly has elected to ignore the Board’s previous public statement following the Board’s meeting with him. In this statement, which was reviewed with him prior to issue, the Board stated that it will issue the results of the business review prior to the season ticket renewal window ending. ‘This position remains unchanged and Mr King is well aware of this having sought personal confirmation on this matter from the Chairman as recently as yesterday.’ They added: ‘When the Board met Mr King a few weeks ago, he made it clear that he did not want to put another penny into the Club and would prefer to see the Club using other investors’ money.  The Board was therefore surprised, but gave him the benefit of the doubt when, a few days later, Mr King made media comments about a willingness to invest his money into the Club.  This is an easy statement to make to the media but is contrary to what he told the whole Board. ‘It is extremely disappointing that Mr King should consider it appropriate to issue this latest statement, clearly designed to unsettle and mislead Rangers fans, on the eve of an important Scottish Cup semi-final match. \'For someone who claims to have the interests of Rangers at heart and as an ex-director, King’s untrue comments are nothing short of disgraceful.’   More...

It’s understood he felt he had no option but to break cover again after the formal launch of season ticket renewals on Wednesday. <br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">King has stated his intention to provide at least £30 million of the £50 million he feels it will take to restore Rangers over the next four years, but wants to do so via a new share issue that would dilute the current power base.<br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If enough fans rally behind his plan, it could force the board to either agree to his wish or risk the club suffer another insolvency event.<br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘It is common cause that the club is not a going concern without access to the season ticket loan from the fans,’ said King. <br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘It is also common cause that the season ticket money will only provide partial relief in advance of a more permanent recapitalisation. <br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘I have hitherto urged restraint in dealing with the board, however due to this extreme act of bad faith I believe that it is vital that fans now withhold season ticket money from this board and similarly refuse to support the club by way of the purchase of replica kit or any other retail product.  <br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘An announcement will shortly be made providing details of a bank account that season ticket money can be paid into as an interim measure. <br/></font></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Dejected: Rangers players after their cup final defeat against Raith Rovers\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"392\" id=\"i-aa710e77\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/11/article-2602649-1CE34F4900000578-264_634x392.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Dejected: Rangers players after their cup final defeat against Raith Rovers</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The specific terms and conditions of this account will be made available to fans, including the basis on which funds will be advanced to the club and the basis on which funds will be returned to fans.

That would be the real betrayal. This board has lost its right to be dealt with on a good faith basis.’ <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">King’s words provoked an equally stern response from within the Ibrox boardroom.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘The Chairman and the Board refute all such allegations in the strongest terms and have referred Mr King’s statement to the Club’s legal advisors,’ said their statement.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘Mr King clearly has elected to ignore the Board’s previous public statement following the Board’s meeting with him. In this statement, which was reviewed with him prior to issue, the Board stated that it will issue the results of the business review prior to the season ticket renewal window ending. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘This position remains unchanged and Mr King is well aware of this having sought personal confirmation on this matter from the Chairman as recently as yesterday.’ <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">They added: ‘When the Board met Mr King a few weeks ago, he made it clear that he did not want to put another penny into the Club and would prefer to see the Club using other investors’ money.  The <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Board was therefore surprised, but gave him the benefit of the doubt when, a few days later, Mr King made media comments about a willingness to invest his money into the Club.  This is an easy statement to make to the media but is contrary to what he told the whole Board.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">‘It is extremely disappointing that Mr King should consider it appropriate to issue this latest statement, clearly designed to unsettle and mislead Rangers fans, on the eve of an important Scottish Cup semi-final match. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">\'For someone who claims to have the interests of Rangers at heart and as an ex-director, King’s untrue comments are nothing short of disgraceful.’ </font> </p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div>\n<div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/football/article-2602058/Scotland-22nd-FIFA-world-rankings-England-11th.html\"> Scotland on the up as Strachan\'s side rise 15 places to 22nd in the FIFA world rankings... with England up to 11th</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/football/article-2601900/Dundee-United-boss-backs-starlet-Moore-battle-skin-cancer.html\"> Dundee United boss backs starlet Moore in his battle with skin cancer</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/football/article-2601878/Jackie-McNamaras-appeal-against-three-match-ban-big-risk-Scottish-Cup-final.html\"> McNamara\'s appeal against three-match ban is big risk for Scottish Cup final</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/football/article-2601853/Ally-McCoist-insists-felt-pain-fans-Ramsdens-Cup-defeat.html\"> McCoist: We felt the same pain as fans after Raith defeat... we\'ll bounce back in Cup semi</a></li> </ul> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"> </font></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"column-content cleared\"> <div class=\"shareArticles\"> <h3 class=\"social-links-title\">Share or comment on this article</h3> <div class=\"social-links cleared\" id=\"socialLinks\"> <ul class=\"bigLinks sc-icns cleared\"> <li class=\"facebook\"> <a class=\"js-tl\" onclick=\'postToFB(\"bottom\");

The 38-year-old will leave the club at the end of the season having failed to impress Daniel Levy after Andre Villas Boas\' sacking in December. And Sherwood admits he \'couldn\'t do without\' management, playing down reports of a future as an assistant.

I\'m not sure I could do without it now.\' As well as denying he had talks over a No 2 role, he also rejected claims he would be interested in the Norwich job, calling it disrespectful. Tottenham travel to play West Brom this weekend, and despite the hosts needing points to secure their Premier League survival, Sherwood insists the match is just as important for his side. \'Any other club\'s need can\'t be greater than ours.

The right-back has been out of action in recent weeks with a pelvic problem, and his manager says that although the injury is worrying, he is sure he will still make the plane to Brazil to play in the World Cup this summer. \'We\'re concerned immediately because he\'s not fit and it would be very doubtful if he were fit for next week. \'He\'s still got  a lot of time before the World Cup and Kyle is one of the best right backs - I\'m sure he\'ll be on the plane even if he doesn\'t make an appearance for Tottenham before the end of the season.\'  Fight against time: Kyle Walker is no nearer to making a comeback with his World Cup dream now in doubt  Sherwood blasts other managers for talking about his job Louis Van Gaal is the favourite to be made the next permanent manager at White Hart Lane, but Sherwood has been consistent in refusing to talk about the future of the club. \'It\'s just about me concentrating on the game and today I\'m concentrating on the game tomorrow. I think those questions are not for me to answer. Its just for me to worry about football matches and hopefully trying to win the next five games for Tottenham. \'That will iron itself out in due course. For me to worry about preparing the team, like I\'ve done this week. We had a good week\'s training and we\'re really going to West Brom on the front foot and trying to entertain those great Tottenham fans and get three points. \'The speculation has never eased since I came in. I\'ve always fended off the questions. I don\'t see a difference from the first hour to now.\'  Summer switch?

with violent conduct by The FA. The charge relates to an incident during his side’s 1-0 defeat to Brentford on Tuesday where the defender appeared to hit a fan. The incident happened late in the game when the ball went out for a throw in into the crowd.   Aggravation: Crawley\'s Paul Connolly (29) is clearly angered by something shouted from the crowd   Cheap shot: Connelly takes a swing at a fan during Brentford\'s 1-0 League One win   Shock: Fans look outraged as stewards split up the altercation and Connelly walks away   Flashpoint: Connolly walks away from the crowd after an altercation with a fan  Connolly appeared to lose his cool and squared up to a fan, who threw the ball back forcefully, before appearing to swing his right arm at the supporter. Stewards were quickly on the scene and diffused the situation but referee Steve Martin nor any of his officials took any action but the incident was caught on video. Connolly said on Twitter on Friday afternoon: ‘Everyone\'s had there say. I did NOT slap/punch the fan. I reacted wrongly but was hugely provoked all game. I\'ll wait for the FA decision. ‘No more to be said at the moment.’ The FA believe Connolly should receive more than the standard three game ban due to the severity of the incident.   More...

Here, PETE JENSON take a look at Paco Alcacer, the youngster who scored a crucial hat-trick for Valencia on Thursday night.  So, who is this guy I’m hearing whispers about? Name: Paco Alcacer Club: Valencia Age: 20 Position: Striker How long has he been on Arsenal’s radar? Top European clubs started looking at Alcacer in 2010 when he top scored in the U17 Euros with six goals for Spain. He was free-scoring 16 year-old in Valencia’s youth academy at the time. He got 14 goals in total in that tournament including qualifying.

Europa League round-up: Valencia complete stunning comeback, while Juventus, Sevilla and Benfica seal semi-final berths Arsenal keep tabs on Valencia striker Alcacer as Wenger plans summer spending Drmic to be scouted by Allardyce this weekend as Hammers boss eyes Arsenal target in quest for more firepower Arsenal players ready to stick together for FA Cup battle against Wigan as the pressure mounts on Wenger WIGAN vs ARSENAL: All the latest team news and stats for the FA Cup semi-final What happened next? His international career continued to go from strength to strength. He got three goals for the U19s as they won the Euros in Romania in 2011, scoring twice in the final against the Czech Republic and a year later he repeated the feat scoring this time in the semi-final against France. And his club form? He was farmed out to Getafe on loan in 2012 but with it written into his contract that he had to play 20 games. It was tough going at their tumbleweed stadium, watched by just two or three thousand supporters in a flat mid-table season he scored just four goals, but still showed enough promise to be recalled and pushed up to the first team this season. He has repaid that faith with 14 goals and that hat-trick to put Valencia in the Europa League semis. What are his key strengths? He is a finisher first and foremost. Quick, strong and clever enough to get in front defenders and get on the end of crosses in the six-yard box. Likes to finish with a first touch as he did to get the winner against Barcelona at the Camp Nou earlier in this year but also has the quick feet to make room for himself in the penalty area.  Composed: Alcacer is a finisher first and foremost, and may be an improvement on Olivier Giroud (below)     So he’s a No 9? He’s technically good with the touch to play with his back to goal and hold the ball up for midfielders to join so he can play in deeper areas but he is at his best when he is getting away from defenders inside the penalty area. Does he create as well as score? Loves to peel off to the right and cross for a team-mate. Not a selfish player despite his goals return – has linked brilliantly with Gerard Deulofeu (now at Everton on loan) and Real Madrid’s Jese, at Spanish youth level. And his character? Has leadership quality. Led the U17s. Takes responsibility be that with the armband or by being the player who takes penalties.  All-round game: He possesses fine technique, and has the ability to set up others as well     But he’s not the biggest… too small for the Premier League? At just under 5ft 9in he won’t be climbing above Vicent Kompany. But he does leap very well and like a lot of good smaller strikers he hangs in the air for that extra half-second to make good contact with the ball. What will it cost to get him out of Valencia? More than it would have done in last transfer window. Goals against Barcelona and Basle have seen to that. Valencia like to fatten the calf before they slaughter it so they will want him to stay next season before selling him for a big price. But his current contract runs out in 2016 and his buy out clause is set at £15m, so a bid this summer which comes close to that might see him leave the Mestalla and head for London.

The Uruguay striker, jointly named the top flight\'s player of the month for March with captain Steven Gerrard, has 29 goals in 28 matches - having been suspended for five league games at the start of the season. Andy Cole, in 1993-94, and Alan Shearer, in the following season, scored 34 in 40 and 42 games respectively, while the record for a 38-game Premier League campaign is 31 - achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo in 2008-09 and Shearer in 1995-96.

This game WILL decide the title\' With five matches remaining, both targets remain within his grasp but Suarez insists team success is more important than personal milestones - and that is the reason why he has not asked to take over spot-kick duty from Gerrard. \'If I wanted to do that I could ask Stevie if I could take a penalty, but I don\'t like that,\' he said. \'For myself it is more important that Liverpool finish in a good position. I try in every game to score because I am a striker. \'I love to make goals but for me if I could swap being top scorer or winning the Golden Boot for the team finishing in the top four that would be more important. \'Of course it would be special (to break the record). In the last few years I have tried to do my job as well as I can to help the team and the Liverpool supporters. \'To finish the season as top scorer or with a new record would be nice for me, for my family and for the Liverpool supporters because it\'s important for them to have a player who holds the record. \'But if I think back a few games, I didn\'t score (he was goalless for five games in February) but I kept trying my best on the pitch.\'  Goal machine: Suarez has scored 29 in 28 matches after missing five matches at the start of the season   Chasing legends: The Uruguay striker is on track to overtake records held by Alan Shearer and Cristiano Ronaldo   On the spot: Suarez\'s goal tally could be even greater if Steven Gerrard handed over penalty taking duties   Liverpool head into the weekend as Premier League leaders but face a crunch clash at home to title rivals Manchester City on Sunday as they look to extend their winning run to 10 successive matches. \'For some people, it\'s a surprise because in the Premier League it is difficult to win nine games in a row,\' Suarez told liverpoolfc.com.  \'But if we continue at this level, we\'ll play very well. \'The team know we\'ve had some really good performances in the last few weeks and we\'ll try to continue in this way.\' \'Our target was to finish in the top four and we\'ve won our last few games. \'We also know Chelsea and City dropped some points, so we\'re at the top of the league now and that\'s amazing for us. \'Now we can\'t stop because we have a really good chance.\'  Plotting: Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard spent 30 minutes working on free-kicks at Melwood   Burst a valve: The manager and his captain are particular about how the ball is placed before it\'s struck   Ready to roll: Suarez and Rodgers watch on as Gerrard hits a stationary ball      More...

He’s spent more than an hour talking about music, his band, buses and washing dishes and now he is thinking of the best song to describe the basketcase, sometimes called Leeds United, that he took over in a £35million deal this week. Knocking on Heaven’s Door is suggested to him. He smirks because he sees potential in the ruins, but then he starts laughing. ‘AC / DC is better,’ he says. ‘Highway to Hell’. With that, the man who the Football League wanted to ban raises his hands in the air. One of his legal staff ponders if the comment should be struck from the record, but the convicted fraudster, the new ‘bus driver’ of Leeds, is having none of it. He is Massimo Cellino and he says what he wants.  New owner: Massimo Cellino, pictured right with Leeds boss Brian McDermott, took over the club this week   Rockstar: Cellino plays guitar with his band Maurilios and used AC/DC\'s \'Highway to Hell\' to describe Leeds Just as he did last month when a stranger called his phone and the 57-year-old Italian responded with a rant about Leeds striker Noel Hunt’s wages and the ‘f****** devil’ David Haigh (Leeds managing director), among other things. Turns out the stranger was recording the conversation for an online broadcast. ‘I was a bit drunk and depressed,’ he says. ‘It was mean and embarrassing that he published it. But after I thought maybe it wasn’t so wrong - that was me.’   More... Football League give Cellino green light to take over Leeds and become club director Zola will NOT replace McDermott at Leeds as Cellino takes charge at Elland Road Is Cellino predicting the score? New Leeds owner joins McDermott in dugout before Watford clash Italian Cellino completes takeover at Leeds and promises to pay all unpaid wages Cellino sacks Lopez as Cagliari coach just hours after sealing Leeds takeover Crooks charter: Football fears the worst after fraudster Cellino is given go-ahead for £35m takeover at Leeds And ‘me’ is complex. He is the guitar-playing, chain-smoking charmer who kept Leeds from administration and fought off a winding-up order this week. He is the man who says of his new club: ‘Leeds has potential to be a Ferrari. Now it is a Cinquecento, or a bicycle.’ When asked what is top of his huge to-do list at Leeds - a club he thinks can be in the  Premier League within two years - he looks down at a sheet of paper, looks up and says: ‘Kill myself.’ He knows how to raise a laugh. But he is also a convicted fraudster; a man recently convicted for not paying import duty on a boat and who has two previous convictions, including one for deceiving the  Italian Ministry of Agriculture out of £7.5m in 1996. Cellino on being hands-on...‘I spend a lot of time at the club, I am an unusual owner. I look after everything - the grass, the cooking.  I want to know what they eat, they drink, where they go on their night out, I want to know everything about the players. If they need something, if they need help I must be there.’  All smiles: Cellino, pictured with his band, believes Leeds can get to the Premier League in two years Rant: Cellino was recorded complaining about Leeds striker Noel Hunt\'s wages when a stranger called him up   Colourful character: Cellino is the guitar-playing, chain-smoking charmer who kept Leeds from administration  In football terms, he has proved his commitment to a club, but in 22 years at Cagliari, which is he now trying to sell, he has sacked 36 managers. He also sacked Leeds boss Brian McDermott in January before the club reinstated him because Cellino’s takeover had not actually gone through. All in all, it’s why the Football League were disappointed that he won an appeal against their decision to keep him out. Now he has arrived, one of the most controversial and bombastic figures in the British game. Over the course of more than an hour, he delivers on the funny stuff but skirts around the gritty particulars. He talks about his first forays into this country, back in 1975, the year Leeds made it to the European Cup final. ‘I was a waiter in London, I did washing up. I came here when I was 18 years old and didn’t have any money. I came here, rock and roll, I was playing guitar but it wasn’t going to earn enough money so I had to wash plates and glasses. I worked in the Regent Palace Hotel in 1975 for eight months.’ Cellino on sacking McDermott in January... \'When I fired the coach at the beginning, not because it was his fault but because I was told so, I was worrying for Leeds to stay in the Championship. I still now, if you ask me what happened that night, I don’t know.\'  Making a point: Leeds striker Ross McCormack (second right) celebrates after scoring earlier this season  In time he became the ‘King of Corn’, inheriting his father’s  successful agricultural company. How much is he worth? ‘I have never been able to find out how much money I have. I can keep an engagement.’ He is adamant he is not a criminal. ‘I’m not dishonest. I didn’t make any contraband, the boat belongs to an American company and I paid the tax in America. I’ve got nothing to hide. Today in Italy there is a big mess.’ There is also a fairly big one to clean up at Leeds, where they do not own the training ground or Elland Road, and whose 2012-13 losses were revealed this week to be £9.5m. The club are currently losing £1m a month, with staff and players deferring 35 per cent of their wages last month. Cellino has promised to settle the salaries this week. But buying back Elland Road, which is rented for more than £1m a year, is described as ‘a first priority’. Cellino on McDermott...‘He is a good guy. Have you seen Brian in a match? What is he doing with the water? He drinks it every 10 seconds and he throws it to the floor, 420 times a match. Bang, he throws it down. When I see him I say, “Here is a bottle of water for the next game”.’  Thumbs up: Cellino has made it his \'first priority\' to buy back the Championship club\'s Elland Road stadium  On the club’s worrying Football League financial fair play position, one of his associates says vaguely: ‘I think the losses this year will be substantial. We have reviewed it (FFP), but because of the way the (takeover) deal is structured, some of the expenses that create the losses are getting written off as part of the deal, so we should qualify for the FFP in 2014.’ For his part, Cellino had not read Leeds’ financial results for 2012-13, which were released the day we met. ‘Please, I am too weak,’ he said. He is more forthcoming on his plans. Gulf Finance House, from whom he bought a 75 per cent stake, retain 25 per cent but will likely be marginalised, as will Haigh. ‘They have not done a good job running Leeds,’ he says. ‘The people who lose money at clubs don’t do it on purpose. But they don’t know that when you take a club you take fans, you take emotions - they are not just numbers. I’ve seen people crying after games - kids, mothers.’ Cellino on divisions of labour...\'There is a big misunderstanding in my point of view between manager and coach. For me, the coach runs the team, the players. The coach has to look after the players and we have to make the team together. \"I like that player. Can we afford him?\" \"OK, let’s do it\".\'  Not just numbers: Cellino admits that actions by a club\'s owners can have an effect on supporters\' emotions    He adds: ‘They were running the bus, now the bus is ours. The other driver is not my problem, he can sit on the bench, he can go fishing, it is not my problem. We run the bus.’ Then there is McDermott. He’s lost eight of the past nine games. ‘A nice guy,’ Cellino says. But in Italy they call Cellino a mangiallenatori - a manager-eater. By his own admission he is hands-on. ‘I like to give Brian the chance to find out if it is good or not,’ he says. ‘If it is not good I have to change. I hope not.’ All being well, he says: ‘Season 2015-16, if we don’t go (to the Premier League) I failed.’ With that, he’s off. His band - he is friends with members of KISS - will soon be playing in front of 25,000 in Sardinia. Before then he has to ‘get to work’ cleaning up Leeds and ‘involving the fans again’. Whatever the outcome of all this, it will be some bus ride.   More...

On the pitch there is little to separate the two teams and the victor from Sunday\'s showdown at Anfield will, in all likelihood, go on to be crowned champions. Off the pitch, however, we can exclusively reveal that Liverpool\'s title-chasing stars are being paid, on average, £2million per year LESS than what their City adversaries.

Liverpool legend Fowler insists lethal striker deserves to win everything this season Richards to leave Manchester City at the end of the season... with Liverpool, West Ham and Newcastle keen Sheik Mansour has bankrolled City\'s emergence over the past six years, an unprecedented investment which has transformed the financial landscape of the English game. In turn, players such as Yaya Toure were rewarded with contracts worth £200,000 a week when they signed up for the Etihad revolution and City have continued to shell out more than any other club for the services of their players. Indeed, their average annual wage is a massive £5,337,944, equating to £102,653 per week. Such outlay means they pay their stars more than any other sporting club in the world, with Major League Baseball\'s New York Yankees a close second.  Investment: Sheik Mansour\'s money has taken Manchester City to a whole new level  But it is the contrast with Liverpool which is most striking. They pay their players an average of £3,403,783 per annum, that is £65,457 each week. A sizeable investment, yes, but when drawn in comparison to City it is proof that shrewd recruitment can pay dividends without breaking the bank. Liverpool, under the canny guidance of Brendan Rodgers and thanks to master marksmen Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, have the destiny of the title in their own hands. Clean sweep: Brendan Rodgers (left) won Manager of the Month for March, while Steven Gerrard (centre) and Luis Suarez were named joint Player of the Month  Kolo Toure sings his own song at Liverpool\'s new kit release Victory in each of their five remaining matches – first up, of course, is City – would see them regain their English crown some 23 years on from being dethroned. In turn, they would become the first side in the Premier League to come from a finish as low as seventh to lift the trophy. It is a common footballing adage that the higher the wage bill the higher the standing in the division; were that the case then City would be champions and Liverpool would be scrapping it out for the Europa League in fifth.  Glory days: Manchester City are looking to reclaim the Premier League crown they won in 2012  The Merseysiders, however, have turned the accounts on their head this season. For the £2m pay disparity ultimately matters not, the only number which counts is the points tally come May 11. To that end, three against their title rivals on Sunday is priceless.

Some of them average more than 10km every game, a superb show of stamina in anyone’s book. And, on the eve of the London Marathon, when 36,000 runners will pound the 26.2 miles around the capital, we can reveal who has been going the furthest for your team. For supporters of West Ham it will come as little surprise to learn that crowd favourite Mark Noble has covered more ground than any other player in the top flight.  Frontrunner: West Ham\'s Mark Noble has covered more ground than any other Premier League player Going the extra mile: Liverpool\'s Jordan Henderson has run just short of 360km this season  TOP TEN DISTANCES COVERED IN 2013/2014 PREMIER LEAGUEPositionPlayerDistance (m)1Mark Noble38,0927.02Mile Jedinak36,4319.93Steve Sidwell36,1070.84Jordan Henderson35,9080.05Adam Lallana35,8094.86Jake Livermore35,1434.87Steven Caulker33,8766.28Jay Rodriguez33,2569.69Tom Huddlestone33,2352.610Ryan Shawcross33,0012.1 Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League Indeed, the 380,927 metres which he has galloped is some 16km more than his nearest running rival. Noble’s effort is the equivalent of having already completed NINE London Marathons this season. Or, in footballing terms, having set off from Upton Park and not stopped until he got to Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium on Teesside. There have been calls in some parts for Noble to be recognised with an international call-up for his performances this term. While unlikely, were that to happen he would be joining an England squad containing comrades of equally admirable work ethic. Within the top five in the distance-covered table are two midfielders surely headed for Brazil – Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson and Southampton’s Adam Lallana. Both have run just shy of 360km this campaign - that is eight-and-a-half marathons. That the pair marry craft to their graft is the reason they’re set for the World Cup and, in the energy-sapping surrounds of Manaus for the opener against Italy, Roy Hodgson could well draw upon their reserves of stamina. But there is a homegrown theme running through our research. In fact, of the top 10, nine are English and seven of those have been capped by their country. Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, tops the charts at Manchester United with 284km, while just outside the top 10 are Chelsea’s Eden Hazard (316km) and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (309km).    Hard yards: Southampton\'s Adam Lallana is fifth in the distance covered table ahead of the World Cup   Club best: Wayne Rooney is top of the charts at Manchester United after running 284km   Work horse: Some may be surprised to hear that Olivier Giroud has done the most running for Arsenal  Somewhat surprisingly, Arsenal’s running man is Olivier Giroud, the forward having got through 307km’s worth of work for his side. As for the one foreign player who resides in the leading 10 players, that is Crystal Palace’s Australia midfielder Mile Jedinak, whose 364km is bettered only by Noble.

terms, having set off from Upton Park and not stopped until he got to Middlesbrough’s Riverside Stadium on Teesside.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">There have been calls in some parts for Noble to be recognised with an international call-up for his performances this term.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">While unlikely, were that to happen he would be joining an England squad containing comrades of equally admirable work ethic.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Within the top five in the distance-covered table are two midfielders surely headed for Brazil – Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson and Southampton’s Adam Lallana. Both have run just shy of 360km this campaign - that is eight-and-a-half marathons.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">That the pair marry craft to their graft is the reason they’re set for the World Cup and, in the energy-sapping surrounds of Manaus for the opener against Italy, Roy Hodgson could well draw upon their reserves of stamina.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">But there is a homegrown theme running through our research. In fact, of the top 10, nine are English and seven of those have been capped by their country.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Wayne Rooney, meanwhile, tops the charts at Manchester United with 284km, while just outside the top 10 are Chelsea’s Eden Hazard (316km) and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (309km).<br/></font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<p>

Yachvili, 33, played for France in the 2011 World Cup final defeat to New Zealand and enjoyed success at club level with Biarritz after launching his top-flight career with a brief stint at Gloucester in 2001/02. Early in his 61-cap international career he played a key role in France winning the Six Nations grand slam in 2004 - including a starring role in a dramatic final game victory against England - and clinching the trophy again two years later, before having peripheral roles in Les Bleus\' 2007 and 2010 triumphs.  Pass master: Dimitri Yachvili is calling time on his rugby career after success with France and Biarritz   Try time: Yachvili scores during the Six Nations-deciding victory against England in 2004  He made his final appearances for France in the 2012 RBS 6 Nations campaign. Biarritz confirmed Yachvili\'s retirement on their website, stating: \'Dimitri Yachvili told (Biarritz president) Serge Blanco on Thursday evening of his decision to bring his career to an end. \'It\'s with great emotion that Biarritz sees a great champion, who has given so much to the Red and White, retire from the rugby field. \'After his titles as champion of France in 2005 and 2006, his two Heineken Cup finals in 2006 and 2010, an Amlin Cup in 2012 but equally a title as vice-champion of the world in New Zealand, we wish Dimitri much success in his new life as a businessman.\'  Trusty boot: The scrum-half often took kicking duties for France, and here lands a penalty at Twickenham   I\'ll drink to that: Yachvili celebrates Biarritz\'s Heineken Cup semi-final win over Bath in 2006  With Biarritz relegated from the Top 14 for next season, Yachvili decided it was time to bow out. He told L\'Equipe: \'It\'s the right moment for me to put an end to my career. I feel that my body needs to stop.\'   More...

The Danish international played four games in the Eredivisie at the start of this campaign before his £11million move to Spurs. And according to reports in Holland that makes Eriksen – as well as Atletico Madrid’s Toby Alderweireld - eligible for a share of the bonus payments made to Ajax’s squad.  Something to celebrate: Christian Eriksen could receive a bonus of £40,000 if Ajax win the league  The full amount of £250,000 is paid to players who appear in at least 25 league matches. Ajax can clinch a fourth successive title this weekend if they beat ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord, in second, fail to win at PSV Eindhoven. Eriksen won three league championships during his time with the club, scoring 10 times during last year’s triumph.  Playing his part: Eriksen started the season at Ajax   Fondly thought of: Eriksen received a warm reception when he went back to Ajax for the game against Heerenveen  He returned to the Amsterdam ArenA earlier this season where he was afforded a spectacular send-off complete with fireworks and his name illuminated in sparklers.

Strange that, with such a stunning array of talent on show, a goalkeeper should attract such a huge amount of attention - but that\'s the life of the player destined to replace Petr Cech as Chelsea\'s No 1. A row ensued after it was revealed Atletico would have to pay £5million to the Blues as part of a clause in the Belgian stopper\'s contract.   Atletico\'s No 1: Courtois kept a clean sheet in the Champions League semi-final second leg with Barcelona   No way through: The threat of Messi was nullified during the Champions League semi-final   Party time! Courtois celebrates with his team-mates after their stunning win over Barcelona   UEFA stepped in to block this move, saying it contravened the governing bodies\' rules. But the intrigue doesn\'t end there. ‘Tell Mourinho where to go!’ shout the autograph hunters through Courtois’ car window at the gates of Atletico\'s Cerro del Espino training complex. The 6ft 6in goalkeeper is one of the players most in demand by fans of the Spanish league leaders. He is a major reason why they are top and the fans are desperate to see him stay next season.  Main man: Cech is currently Chelsea\'s No 1 choice in goal... but he could be replaced by Courtois   Thriller: Chelsea overturned a 3-1 deficit to beat PSG to a place in the Champions League semi-final    ‘He has learned a lot with us. He needs to keep getting better but it is obvious he is destined for big things,’ said Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone after his goalkeeper had a brilliant game in the 1-1 draw at Barcelona on Tuesday in the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final tie. ‘He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world,’ insisted Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino after the 21-year-old had kept out Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Leo Messi. In fact, Messi has failed to score against him in four games so far this season. Courtois’ key strengths are the fact that, despite his huge frame, he is agile enough to get down quickly to low shots and he inspires confidence in his defence by commanding his area.  Key man: Atletico fans are desperate to keep hold of the Belgian goalkeeper   Not invincible: Barcelona forward Neymar wheels away after finally beating Courtois in the all-Spanish Champions League quarter-final at the Nou Camp earlier this week    Share or comment on this article 23shares','\n<p class=\"author-section\">By <a class=\"author\" href=\"/home/search.html?s=&amp;authornamef=Pete+Jenson\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pete Jenson</a> <span class=\"follow-author\"> <a class=\"twitter-follow-button twitter-follow-author\" data-show-count=\"false\" href=\"https://twitter.com/@petejenson\">Follow @@petejenson</a> </span> </p>\n<p class=\"byline-section\"><span class=\"article-timestamp article-timestamp-published\"> <span class=\"article-timestamp-label\">Published:</span> 07:39 EST, 11 April 2014 </span> | <span class=\"article-timestamp article-timestamp-updated\"> <span class=\"article-timestamp-label\">Updated:</span> 07:58 EST, 11 April 2014 </span> </p>\n<div id=\"articleIconLinksContainer\"> <ul> <li class=\"share-facebook\" onclick=\"postToFB(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-twitter\" onclick=\"postToTWTTR(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-pinterest\" onclick=\"postToPinterest(\'top\'); return false;\"></li> <li class=\"share-gplus\"> <span class=\"g-interactivepost\" data-calltoactionlabel=\"VIEW\" data-calltoactionurl=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2602464/Chelsea-want-5m-Atletico-Thibaut-Courtois-play-against-heres-Cech-wary-opposite-number.html\" data-clientid=\"746589970956-e10ciaf67a1id9ggu75ph3ds0sthn7j6.apps.googleusercontent.com\" data-contentdeeplinkid=\"/pages\" data-contenturl=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2602464/Chelsea-want-5m-Atletico-Thibaut-Courtois-play-against-heres-Cech-wary-opposite-number.html\" data-cookiepolicy=\"single_host_origin\" data-prefilltext=\"Chelsea want £5m from Atletico for Courtois to play against them... here\'s why the young keeper is rated among the world\'s best\"> <a onclick=\'postToGPlus(\"top\"); return false;\'></a> </span> </li> <li class=\"share-icons\" id=\"shareLinkTop\"> <a class=\"js-sl share-link\" href=\"#socialLinks\"> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=\"share-count\"> <b> 23</b> <span>shares</span> </div> <a class=\"comments-count home\" href=\"/sport/football/article-2602464/Chelsea-want-5m-Atletico-Thibaut-Courtois-play-against-heres-Cech-wary-opposite-number.html#comments\"> <span></span> <p class=\"count-number\">4</p> <p class=\"count-text\">View <br/> comments</p> </a> </div>\n<br/>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Thibaut Courtois will take centre stage when Atletico Madrid and Chelsea duel it out for a place in the Champions League final later this month. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Strange that, with such a stunning array of talent on show, a goalkeeper should attract such a huge amount of attention - but that\'s the life of the player destined to replace Petr Cech as Chelsea\'s No 1. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">A row ensued after it was revealed Atletico would have to pay £5million to the Blues as part of a clause in the Belgian stopper\'s contract. <br/></font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Atletico\'s No 1: Courtois kept a clean sheet in the Champions League semi-final second leg with Barcelona\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"470\" id=\"i-60e30d5a\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/11/article-0-1CF99DEE00000578-251_634x470.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Atletico\'s No 1: Courtois kept a clean sheet in the Champions League semi-final second leg with Barcelona</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"No way through: The threat of Messi was nullified during the Champions League semi-final\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"518\" id=\"i-60b00d5c\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/11/article-0-1CF95FEC00000578-803_634x518.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">No way through: The threat of Messi was nullified during the Champions League semi-final</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Party time!

The England striker has fired Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table alongside fellow strike partner Luis Suarez, and Brendan Rodgers\' side face City at Anfield on Sunday in what could potentially be a title-deciding game. But Sturridge reckons he would never have forced his way past the legion of expensive foreign imports at City - his first club - and would be languishing in Manuel Pellegrini\'s reserves alongside other academy graduates such as Micah Richards and Dedryck Boyata, who rarely get a chance in the first team.

The 29-year-old Mercedes driver returned from Bahrain, where he was taking part in testing following his win in the Gulf Kingdom at the weekend.

The plan was just to get in as many laps as we could.

Sportsmail’s Jamie Redknapp met Toure ahead of Sunday’s title showdown between Liverpool and City to talk title chances, conquering Europe and becoming the next Patrick Vieira. Andrew Magee listened in. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Michael Owen previewing Liverpool v Manchester City  Jamie: Yaya, it is a huge game against Liverpool. Do you think it will decide the title? Yaya: No doubt about it, the game will be very important. We know how difficult it will be against teams fighting relegation but the important thing is going to Liverpool and trying to get a good result. After that we have to continue to perform because if we want to win the league we have to win all games. Jamie: When you won the title in 2012 it was all about competing with Manchester United but this year it has been Chelsea and now Liverpool. Have Liverpool impressed you?  All smiles: Jamie Redknapp (left) and Yaya Toure share a joke at Manchester City\'s training base   Versatile: Toure tells Jamie how he reinvented his game to become a fearsome midfield player   Strike a pose: Redknapp and Toure smile for Sportsmail\'s Andy Hooper in CarringtonYaya: They have been amazing. They have had the advantage of playing one game a week and so they have been fresh. With players of their calibre, it helps to train all week and prepare for one game. It’s going to be very, very tough until the end.Jamie: Who has impressed you?Yaya: Defensively they have been good but in midfield they are so strong. Steven Gerrard is fantastic and has so much experience. And Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge have been unbelievable. They score goals like a machine. Things are going to be tough for our defence and if we make a mistake, or we are not concentrating 100 per cent, we are going to pay.Jamie: I’ve been watching you in the Champions League for years and you used to be the perfect defensive midfielder. Now you’ve turned into a goalscoring midfielder. What’s changed?   Man on man: Toure and Jamie appear to be enjoying one another\'s company   Under the spotlight: Toure and Redknapp were talking ahead of Manchester City\'s clash with Liverpool  More...

I remember the first chat I had with Arsene Wenger. He asked me: ‘Yaya, which position do you want to play?’ I told him I wanted to be a midfielder. He said: ‘Why? When I saw you training, for me you look more like a striker.’ I said: ‘Ah, that’s why you keep playing me up front! Move me, I want to play in midfield like Patrick Vieira. I can play like Patrick and I can be better than Patrick.’ He said: ‘No, no. That’s impossible. No one is better than Patrick.’Jamie: Are you better than him now?Yaya: (laughing) No, Patrick is unbelievable, with the trophies he has. Arsene liked me further  forward because when I was training close to the goal I would take five shots and score with four of them. That was not too bad, but for me I wanted to definitely play in midfield. Then when I went back to Belgium the manager moved me further forward. It was nice and I enjoyed it but after that I moved back into midfield. Jamie: Take me back to your early career. Is it true that when you first came to Europe you arrived as a young man with no boots?Yaya: (laughing) Yeah! When I was 16 in Ivory Coast I played for ASEC Mimosas in Abidjan. It was a great club in my country and after that I started to think about what would be the next level for me. In my mind all the big players are supposed to play in Europe. That was my target — to be there and compare myself to them. That’s when I came to Belgium and started to play in the first team in Beveren.   Big task: Toure will hope to dominate the game at Anfield and hand City a title boost   Words of wisdom: Toure is targeting his second Premier League title with Manchester City  Jamie: Then you went and played in Ukraine. That must have been quite a contrast from growing up in Africa? Yaya: Yes, I played for Metalurh Donetsk and it was an amazing experience. Coming from Africa, I started to learn how to eat properly, how to get rest and concentrate and I started to understand the high level of sport. You need to be careful with when you go out. You have to get more rest, and you have to be very, very focused. Jamie: Then another move, this time to Greece? Yaya: I spent one year at Olympiacos and won two trophies, so it was a good year! I got to play with Rivaldo, too, and he taught me so much. He gave me a lot of confidence for when I went to Barcelona. We won the Greek league and cup. Jamie: And after success in Greece you spent a season in Monaco before the big move to Barcelona. Then you got to play with Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta. It must have been incredible to work with players like that? Yaya: It was unbelievable. In my second year I won six trophies, which was an amazing achievement for an African player coming from Monaco. I was the only player who came from a small club but I learned so much about preparing for games and being professional. After that I always came to training an hour or two early because, for me, that’s very important.  Goal threat: Toure, pictured celebrating against United, has netted 18 Premier League goals this season   Well travelled: Toure slides in on Wayne Rooney during Barcelona\'s victorious Champions League final against Manchester United in 2009Jamie: I read a few weeks ago that Barcelona said the one player they would like to sign again was you...Yaya: (laughing) I know they loved me there and it was difficult to get out of Barcelona. Pep Guardiola said he wanted me to stay, but I knew it was the right time for me to go. I was 27 and it was time to move on and try to continue to play. I wanted to come to England with a big club and win trophies.Jamie: You lost to Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League last month. How do you think City can make the strides needed to become European champions?Yaya: We already are. We have a fantastic manager and we are playing good football, which the players are enjoying a lot. We have a few things to do better and there are always some difficult clubs that will cause us a lot of problems.  The Barcelona game was a good example. We went out because of our first game, at home, where we respected them a lot. By the second game we showed different things but by then it was too late. It’s good for next year. Kolo Toure: We\'re fighting for the title, definitely   Family affair: Yaya trained with Arsenal where his older brother Kolo (right) became a key part of the squad Kolo Toure sings his own song at Liverpool\'s new kit release   Staying put: The Toure brothers played together at City but Yaya remained at the Etihad after Kolo moved on   Jamie: It sounds bright for the future, but what about this year? In 2012 you won the title with  Roberto Mancini and now you have Manuel Pellegrini in charge. Is there much difference between the two managers? Yaya: It’s difficult to criticise the managers because they both work us very hard. Mancini had a different style, it was more about defensive skill, and with Pellegrini we are more attacking. All the players are enjoying it and we are improving. Samir Nasri and David Silva are doing fantastically well and Sergio Aguero is fantastic. We got new signings who have helped a lot. Jesus Navas and Alvaro Negredo have been great this season and I hope, with all this hard work we have done, at the end we will lift this trophy. Jamie: I’ve not seen many players come into the league and settle as quickly as Fernandinho. He is the perfect foil for you, he sits and protects the back four while you work your magic. Is he easy to play with?  Mean machine: Toure has been impressed with Luis Suarez (left) and Daniel Sturridge this season   Clash of the titans: Toure will square off against another first-class midfielder in Steven Gerrard on SundayYaya: He’s very clever. Brazilians play pretty, fantastic football and Fernandinho is clever — he anticipates well, he presses well. His movement is so good but he can play with the ball as well. Before he came to City, he was at Shakhtar playing in my position, more as an offensive midfielder. Sometimes we have some difficulties because when he attacks I have to stay more to protect the defence, but we are doing well and he helps me a lot. The manager demands a lot from us because he wants us to have more of the ball and he wants us to attack. He doesn’t want to just score and defend.Jamie: You have scored 22 goals this season, including some spectacular free-kicks. When I watched you at Barcelona you never took a free-kick and now you’re bending them in the top corner every time! What’s changed? Do you practise them a lot?Yaya: Of course. In my first year with Mancini, I took them in training. But in a game it was difficult because Carlos Tevez would just take the ball and hit it.Jamie: Was he a bit greedy?   Dynamic duo: Fernandinho (right) and Toure have struck up some partnership in the City midfield  Yaya: Yes! And Mario Balotelli. But afterwards it was easier. Because I’m an experienced player, I’m calmer than the rest. When I want to shoot, first of all I only take a few steps back. For me it’s not just about the power, it’s about the technique as well. When you hit the ball, it has to be with precision. In England, you get a lot of tall players in the wall and it can be difficult to get the ball up and down quickly. Jamie: What about penalties? Did you learn any techniques from playing with Messi and Drogba? Yaya: Penalties are all about being calm. Joe Hart is very good  with penalties: he’s quick in his  movement, goes down very fast and he waits until the last minute. It makes it difficult in training for us but it’s good for me because in a match you can come up against a good goalkeeper who can stop your penalty, but we have had practice. Jamie: When you won the title in 2012, it came down to that last-gasp winner from Sergio Aguero. Do you think the same thing could happen this year? Yaya: I hope so! I remember in 2012, it was so difficult until the last minute. I hope Aguero will be fit because we need him. Edin Dzeko and Negredo have been fantastic this season, but especially Aguero. He makes such a difference. Jamie: Are there any individuals at Liverpool you will be watching out for? Do you have any special plans for Luis Suarez?  High praise: Toure believes City can become European champions under the guidance of Manuel Pellegrini  Yaya: This year they have been playing as a team. Brendan Rodgers is a great manager and everybody has been happy with him. Even my brother Kolo has had low game time but he is very happy with him. He always keeps his team 100 per cent fit and concentrating so it’s going to be tough. Against Liverpool, everything is going to come from everywhere. Gerrard can score penalties and free-kicks and Suarez is a danger man. But football is all about winning, about technique, about being clever and sharper. We are playing very well and we have a fantastic side. My target is to win a lot of trophies with this club. Jamie: Yaya, it’s been a pleasure.

I remember the first chat I had with Arsene Wenger. He asked me: ‘Yaya, which position do you want to play?’ I told him I wanted to be a midfielder. He said: ‘Why? When I saw you training, for me you look more like a striker.’ I said: ‘Ah, that’s why you keep playing me up front! Move me, I want to play in midfield like Patrick Vieira. I can play like Patrick and I can be better than Patrick.’ He said: ‘No, no. That’s impossible. No one is better than Patrick.’</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>Are you better than him now?</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya: </b>(laughing) No, Patrick is unbelievable, with the trophies he has. Arsene liked me further  forward because when I was training close to the goal I would take five shots and score with four of them. That was not too bad, but for me I wanted to definitely play in midfield. Then when I went back to Belgium the manager moved me further forward. It was nice and I enjoyed it but after that I moved back into midfield. </font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>Take me back to your early career. Is it true that when you first came to Europe you arrived as a young man with no boots?</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya: </b>(laughing) Yeah! When I was 16 in Ivory Coast I played for ASEC Mimosas in Abidjan. It was a great club in my country and after that I started to think about what would be the next level for me. In my mind all the big players are supposed to play in Europe. That was my target — to be there and compare myself to them. That’s when I came to Belgium and started to play in the first team in Beveren.</font></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Big task: Toure will hope to dominate the game at Anfield and hand City a title boost\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"446\" id=\"i-ac5b0e8e\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601625-1CCEB6E200000578-649_634x446.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Big task: Toure will hope to dominate the game at Anfield and hand City a title boost</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Words of wisdom: Toure is targeting his second Premier League title with Manchester City\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"423\" id=\"i-aa830e75\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601625-1CCEB38500000578-147_634x423.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Words of wisdom: Toure is targeting his second Premier League title with Manchester City</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>Then you went and played in Ukraine.

Coming from Africa, I started to learn how to eat properly, how to get rest and concentrate and I started to understand the high level of sport. You need to be careful with when you go out. You have to get more rest, and you have to be very, very focused. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>Then another move, this time to Greece?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya:</b> I spent one year at Olympiacos and won two trophies, so it was a good year!

We won the Greek league and cup. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>And after success in Greece you spent a season in Monaco before the big move to Barcelona. Then you got to play with Lionel Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta. It must have been incredible to work with players like that?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya: </b>It was unbelievable. In my second year I won six trophies, which was an amazing achievement for an African player coming from Monaco. I was the only player who came from a small club but I learned so much about preparing for games and being professional.

Brazilians play pretty, fantastic football and Fernandinho is clever — he anticipates well, he presses well. <br/></font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">His movement is so good but he can play with the ball as well. Before he came to City, he was at Shakhtar playing in my position, more as an offensive midfielder. Sometimes we have some difficulties because when he attacks I have to stay more to protect the defence, but we are doing well and he helps me a lot. The manager demands a lot from us because he wants us to have more of the ball and he wants us to attack. He doesn’t want to just score and defend.</font></p><p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>You have scored 22 goals this season, including some spectacular free-kicks.

And Mario Balotelli. But afterwards it was easier. Because I’m an experienced player, I’m calmer than the rest. When I want to shoot, first of all I only take a few steps back. For me it’s not just about the power, it’s about the technique as well. When you hit the ball, it has to be with precision. In England, you get a lot of tall players in the wall and it can be difficult to get the ball up and down quickly.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie: </b>What about penalties? Did you learn any techniques from playing with Messi and Drogba?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya: </b>Penalties are all about being calm. Joe Hart is very good  with penalties: he’s quick in his  movement, goes down very fast and he waits until the last minute. It makes it difficult in training for us but it’s good for me because in a match you can come up against a good goalkeeper who can stop your penalty, but we have had practice.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Jamie:</b> When you won the title in 2012, it came down to that last-gasp winner from Sergio Aguero. Do you think the same thing could happen this year?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\"><b>Yaya:</b> I hope so! I remember in 2012, it was so difficult until the last minute.

McIlroy finished one under par, a shot ahead of Graeme McDowell and three behind first-round leader Bill Haas. He could have been a shot closer but for a dropped shot at the 18th, but McIlroy was pleased with surviving 18 holes notable for the speed of the greens. ‘They are getting firm and fast already. There are putts you hit, look like they’re going in, then they shave the edge and you’re four or five feet by.  Fairway to go: Rory McIlroy is well placed after a promising first round at the Masters   Now watch this drive: The Northern Irishman tees off on the famous final hole at Augusta on Thursday   Challenge: McIlroy reckons the greens will become harder under the sun as the week goes on  ‘To score anything around 70 today, people would take it,’ he said. However, with the ground expected to get even harder under a baking Georgian sun, McIlroy admitted he will have to adapt as his powerful long game will not count for as much. ‘It brings the guys that don’t hit it as far, into the mix a little bit more, because it’s not just about power. It’s about precision and making sure you’re going to the right place and it becomes more of a mental challenge than anything else. ‘It hasn’t been my forte in the past, but I’ll learn to love it this week.’ Pink hair and Geordie light-entertainment mavens were but two features of the McIlroy caravan during the first round. He was a favourite for this tournament even before the withdrawal of Tiger Woods, but the fiendishness of Augusta National has crumbled big fancies to dust in the past. Short odds, then, did not explain the large crowds following him.

The super middleweight will fight Brandon Gonzalez on the undercard of George Groves’ rematch with Carl Froch at Wembley on May 31. The two winners will meet later in the year, possibly giving DeGale the chance to avenge his defeat to bitter rival Groves in 2011.  Deal sealed: James DeGale has signed with Eddie Hearn\'s Matchroom and will fight at Wembley on May 31 Big bout: DeGale will fight on the Carl Froch-George Groves undercard against Brandon Gonzales James DeGale joins Matchroom The 28-year-old was speaking as he confirmed his switch to Eddie Hearn’s Matchroom stable after leaving Mick Hennessy last week. ‘If I\'m brutally honest, I was unhappy, depressed if anything,’ he admitted. I wasn’t sleeping at night, constantly thinking about my next move. ‘I didn’t want to train, there was a time I wanted to give it the elbow and give up. ‘But I’ve got a good family and team around me and they were like, “James, stop being stupid”. ‘They got me back on track and I feel re-energized now and I’ve got a new lease of life. ‘If I were you lot, I’d fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.’  Defeat: DeGale suffered the first loss of his professional career to George Groves in May 2011 On board: Hearn has snapped up DeGale after he split with promoter Mick Hennessy last week When pressed on which of his British rivals he wanted to fight, DeGale added: \'Groves. But I\'m not too sure if he\'s going to win. It\'s a 50/50 fight and I can\'t pick who\'s going to win but i want my revenge on \"ugly boy\". \'But I can\'t overlook this guy. He\'s unbeaten and trained with Andre Ward and Amir Khan so that must give him an extra push.\' DeGale, who is bidding to become the first British Olympic gold medallist to win a professional world title, has endured a frustrating time since his contentious defeat to Groves. Despite beating Piotr Wilczewski to win the European title just five months later, a shot at the ultimate prize has thus far remained elusive. DeGale signed with Hennessy after leaving Frank Warren in 2012 but it has taken six fights to manoeuvre him into a mandatory position with the WBC.  Aiming high: DeGale is bidding to become the first British Olympic gold medallist to win a world title   Addressing the media: Hearn and DeGale announce the new deal at a press conference in London  Gold: DeGale won the middleweight competition at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing He has instead opted to fight a final eliminator to challenge for the IBF belt held by Froch - at least for the time being. But while his bitter west London rival Groves has seen his profile rocket following his controversial defeat to Froch last November, DeGale\'s has plummeted in equal measure. From the O2 Arena to a shopping centre in Kent, DeGale has slipped off British boxing’s radar. He will hope that is all about to change.   More...

With just a month left in this season’s title race, it looks like being one of the closest finishes yet with Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea all eyeing up the prize come May. While Chelsea has been accustomed to fighting for domestic dominance since the arrival of Roman Abramovich, Liverpool are relatively new to the experience having finished seventh last season.

Aguero ready for Liverpool as star steps up injury recovery in training Olympiacos target Boyata as City defender looks set to leave Etihad this summer LIVERPOOL vs MANCHESTER CITY: All the latest team news and stats for the crunch battle in race for Premier League title As for City, they can harp back to memories of two seasons ago when they snatched the title out of arch rivals Manchester United’s hands on goal difference thanks to a last-gasp Sergio Aguero strike against QPR on the final day. But with this campaign fast becoming a three-horse race with an extra team thrown into the mix, England goalkeeper Hart is adamant City’s maiden Premier League success and the pressures it put them through will have no bearing on the destination of the title this season. \'I have been lucky that a lot of my career so far has been pretty exciting,\' said Hart, speaking on behalf of the Gillette Great Start programme. \'There has always been stuff coming up or things on the horizon and right now we are in the thick of a title race. \'I don’t know if having been there and done it before helps. It has not been a hindrance but things have changed and times changed and everything is different.  Leaving it late: Sergio Aguero scores against QPR in the dying seconds of the season to win the title in 2012   We\'ve done it! Hart celebrates the dramatic end to the 2012 season   Winning the big one: City players celebrate with the Premier League title  \'It is not a bad thing that a few of us have got a winner’s medal already but we are all just as hungry for another one and while everything is different we are ready for it. \'It is going to be an exciting day on Sunday against Liverpool first and foremost and that is what we are concentrating on. There has been a lot of build up but we remain focused. \'We had a big game at the weekend against Southampton and got a good result out of that so we go into Liverpool confident.\' Hart also has a World Cup in football’s spiritual home of Brazil to occupy his thoughts, although earlier this season it didn’t look too promising. After a momentary loss of form Hart was dropped for Costel Pantilimon in November with the Romanian holding the fort for two months.  Brazil bound: Hart is hoping to help England do well at the World Cup this summer  But Hart was thrown back into the thick of the action just before Christmas against Fulham and he hasn’t looked back since, producing a string of commanding performances to cement his place as No 1 at Manchester City and also for England. \'We [Man City] have put ourselves in the position with a lot of hard work and hopefully that will finish the way we want to with that even bigger carrot of the summer tournament for me,\' he added. \'It is easy to get carried away and look forward to that but right now it is hard because there is so much going on in my football life right now. \'I am focused on things with Man City and I believe that if that all goes well I can take it on into the summer.  Flying save: Hart believes City can go on and win the title - but says it won\'t be easy  \'We all want to finish our season well for our clubs and see where we go from there.\' Meanwhile, Hart’s first goalkeeping coach Dave Timmins believes Joe Hart’s loyalty to Shrewsbury has been crucial in propelling the England shot stopper to the cusp of a World Cup debut. Timmins first encountered Hart when the young goalkeeper was just eight, the coach and his apprentice joining forces at Shrewsbury Town and with Shropshire Schools Football. The relationship lasted a decade before Hart, who is a brand ambassador for Gillette and is helping to launch this year’s Great Start programme, was picked up by Man City in 2006, the 26-year-old being able to boast Premier League and FA Cup-winning campaigns on his CV.  Starting out: Hart began his career at Shrewsbury   Reunited: Hart attends a training session with Dave Timmins - his first goalkeeping coach  But the two were reunited on Monday at the AJ Bell Stadium to help launch the 2014 Gillette Great Start Programme, which supports and celebrates great coaches who inspire the next generation at every level by awarding coaching grants through the scheme. \'I first came across Joe most probably when he was eight years of age with Shrewsbury Town, Timmins said. \'We used to train on a second hand light off the Astroturf on the grass and he just loved diving around. \'And quite quickly after about six weeks we moved him up into the under-11s and 12s group because he wasn’t afraid. \'When he was about 13 or 14 was when I really started to see that there was something special about Joe. \'It was quite funny really because he was trialing at other clubs but for whatever reason they never sorted it out with him. \'It was good really because it was good for me, good for Shrewsbury Town and I believe good for himself too as he got to experience first team football rather than potentially just sit on a bench somewhere. \'He is a loyal lad too, loyal to Shrewsbury Town and at that age he just stuck with it and look where he is now.\'  Gillette’s Great Start programme celebrates the role of coaching and encourages people to get into coaching by offering grants.

The events of April 15, 1989 changed football profoundly and, while the crusade for justice continues in the courts, we will this weekend take a moment to reflect and remember those who died supporting the team they loved. Across the English football schedule, matches will kick off seven minutes later than usual, preceded by a minutes\' silence in memory of the victims.  25th anniversary: Steven Gerrard holds up a commemorative patch to be worn on Liverpool\'s shirts during Sunday\'s match with Manchester City, as football marks the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough Disaster   Never forgotten: Kick-offs have been pushed back seven minutes and there will be a minute\'s silence before every game in England this weekend, while Liverpool will honour the 96 victims with this shirt tribute   Eternal flame: Floral tributes left at the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield on last year\'s anniversary  It will be particularly emotional at Anfield, where Liverpool take on Manchester City in a season-defining game on Sunday afternoon. That\'s the weekend\'s highlight but we also have the pick of the action from the FA Cup semi-finals, Football League and beyond.  Liverpool vs Manchester City, Barclays Premier League, Sunday 1.37pm, Sky Sports 1  There will be no louder roar in an English football stadium this season than when Mark Clattenburg blows his whistle to signal the end of the minutes\' silence at Anfield on Sunday afternoon. For Liverpool fans, the occasion will be emotional enough as they mark the passing of 25 years since the Hillsborough tragedy took 96 of their brothers. That combined with the very real chance they are going to win their first league championship in 24 years will almost be enough to lift the roof off.  Written in the stars: With the team sat top of the Premier League, Liverpool fans are dreaming of a first title triumph in 24 years   Pointing the way to the title? Manager Brendan Rodgers during Liverpool\'s training session on Thursday ahead of their important clash with Manchester City   Sitting pretty: Liverpool currently enjoy a two-point lead over Chelsea and four over Manchester City  Sunday\'s season-defining match between the two title favourites is the hottest ticket on Merseyside in years, with £5,000 needed to buy a pair from certain online vendors this week. There are many who see a Liverpool triumph as a breath of fresh air for the league, smashing the hegemony of the Manchester clubs and Chelsea at long last. Manager Brendan Rodgers wants his team to cross the finish line first to honour the memories of the \'96 fans in the sky\' and he will be encouraged ahead of this big game by the statistics. Liverpool have faced four of the top seven at Anfield this season and won them all, scoring 14 goals and conceding just once.  Unplayable: Luis Suarez has scored 29 league goals this season to propel Liverpool\'s title push   In hot pursuit: Stevan Jovetic rounds off Manchester City\'s 4-1 win over Southampton last weekend   Outstanding: Yaya Toure has scored 18 league goals from midfield - the third-highest tally in the top scorers\' chart  More... Bumming around! Liverpool in good spirits ahead of title showdown as Suarez and Co are put through their paces Ronaldo injury rocks Real! Star could be out of the Copa del Rey final with muscle tear Messi can\'t be bothered, Xavi\'s too weak and they\'re a shambles at the back. What the hell is going on at Barcelona? MARTIN SAMUEL - THE DEBATE: I\'m not anti-Everton, I\'m just against the loan system - but the foolish paranoia of football fans never ceases to amaze me TACKLE KEOWN: Why Azpilicueta could be just the man to stop rampant Robben... and who was the fittest star I ever played with? They also have a very good home record against Manchester City, who have won just one of the last 16 Anfield meetings - and that was 11 years ago. In terms of the engrossing title race, a Liverpool win would take them seven points clear of City, who retain two matches in hand. Three points for City and the pendulum swings towards them, while a draw brings Chelsea back into contention. They play at Swansea later on Sunday afternoon. Hopefully the match will live up to expectations - on the face of it, we should see goals galore. Liverpool have scored 90 league goals this season, just three shy of City\'s overall total from their title-winning 2011-2012 campaign. City have 84 themselves this term. There\'s really no excuse for the strikers!  Wigan Athletic vs Arsenal, FA Cup semi-final, Wembley, Saturday 5.07pm, ITV With such important fixtures in the Premier League, it\'s quite easy to forget it\'s FA Cup semi-final weekend as well. Arsenal will be the clear bookmakers\' favourites to end their nine-year trophy drought by winning the competition but an upset cannot be ruled out against Wigan. While league status, squad strength and Cup pedigree all point to a Gunners victory on Saturday teatime, there is a nagging feeling of foreboding after the Latics\' dual wins over Manchester City in last season\'s final and this season\'s sixth round.  Repeat performance: Wigan won the FA Cup last season, stunning Manchester City in the final, and will aim to do the same against Arsenal   Deja-vu: James Perch celebrates scoring what proved to be Wigan\'s winning goal against Manchester City in the sixth round   Long wait: Arsenal last lifted the FA Cup in 2005 but are favourites to end their trophy drought this time  ARSENAL\'S ROAD TO WEMBLEY 3rd Round Tottenham (H) 2-04th Round Coventry City (H) 4-05th Round Liverpool (H) 2-16th Round Everton (H) 4-1 The two sides have never met in the FA Cup but Arsenal dominate the overall head-to-head record with 15 wins out of 20. They were also responsible for sending Wigan back down into the Championship last season, just three days after they had stunned Manchester City in the final. \'We are the massive underdogs,\' said Wigan manager Uwe Rosler. \'We are going to Wembley, we can\'t lose. We only can win. \'Arsenal really have to go for the FA Cup, their own players said it this week. That puts extra pressure on Arsenal.\'  Underdog: Uwe Rosler is confident that Wigan can spring another surprise at Arsenal on Saturday   Match winner: Wigan\'s Martyn Waghorn celebrates his goal against Leeds United last weekend but the Latics lost to Millwall in midweek  WIGAN\'S ROAD TO WEMBLEY 3rd Round MK Dons (H) 3-3Replay MK Dons (A) 3-14th Round Crystal Palace (H) 2-15th Round Cardiff City (A) 2-16th Round Manchester City (A) 2-1 As does a backlog of injuries that has not exactly helped as Arsenal\'s title challenge fell apart and their grip on the fourth Champions League has floundered. Arsene Wenger will be without Mathieu Flamini, who must serve a two-match suspension after collecting a 10th yellow card of the season at Everton. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Tomas Rosicky, Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Jack Wilshere are all on the treatment table, giving the manager a bit of a selection headache. Could it all be set for another glorious giant-killing from Wigan?  Off the boil: Arsenal\'s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League took a hit with a 3-0 defeat at Everton last weekend   Missing: Mathieu Flamini (centre) is suspended and one of a number of players Arsene Wenger will have to do without at Wembley   Hull City vs Sheffield United, FA Cup semi-final, Wembley, Sunday 4.07pm, BT Sport 1 Expect a sizeable migration south from Yorkshire on Sunday as Hull City and Sheffield United aim to book a return Wembley ticket for the end of next month. Both teams have embarked on remarkable runs to reach this stage and though it\'s first tier against third, you would imagine the occasion will provide a leveller. It\'s been an eventful week on Humberside as owner Assem Allam\'s attempts to change the club\'s name to Hull Tigers was thrown out by the FA Council.  Rejected: The FA Council this week turned down an application by Hull City owner Assem Allam to change to club\'s name to Hull Tigers   Dyed in the wool: Hull fans have staged protests at the KC Stadium against the proposed name change  HULL CITY\'S ROAD TO WEMBLEY 3rd Round Middlesbrough (A) 2-04th Round Southend United (A) 2-05th Round Brighton (H) 2-16th Round Sunderland (H) 3-0 It had looked like the vocal fan protests inside the ground had fallen on deaf ears when a rather suspicious and undemocratic ballot of less than half of season ticket holders found that a \'majority\' were in favour of a change. But just as Allam thought he finally had a mandate, the authorities sensibly stopped the plans dead. It now remains to be seen whether the Egyptian takes the matter further but it\'s good to see the powers that be taking a stand against careless owners who think a century of history and heritage can be tossed away on a whim.  Staying out of it: Hull manager Steve Bruce has kept his counsel on the name change   Close knit: Hull\'s players celebrate George Boyd\'s winner in last weekend\'s 1-0 home win over Swansea, a result that should secure their Premier League survival  In the meantime, manager Steve Bruce has kept his counsel and concentrated on this historic occasion, admitting he has a series of \'horrible\' selection dilemmas to address. \'I\'ve got 25 players and I can pick 11, so I\'m going to have more people disappointed than happy,\' Bruce told the Hull Daily Mail. Should they do what is expected and beat the Blades, they will reach a first ever Cup final. The Sheffield club, meanwhile, have not reached the showpiece since 1936, when they lost to Arsenal.  Up for the Cup: Progression to the final would continue an extraordinary season for Nigel Clough and his Sheffield United side   Local bragging rights: Ben Davies converted a late penalty as Sheffield United beat Rotherham at Bramall Lane in midweek  SHEFF UNITED\'S ROAD TO WEMBLEY 3rd Round Aston Villa (A) 2-14th Round Fulham (H) 1-1Replay Fulham (A) 1-05th Round Nottingham Forest (H) 3-16th Round Charlton Athletic (H) 2-0 Their season has been extraordinary - from the depths of League One and the very real prospect of dropping into the fourth tier, to a top-half finish and a Cup semi-final. With one eye on Sunday, manager Nigel Clough changed eight players for Tuesday night\'s derby with Rotherham United and they still had enough to end the Millers\' 16-game unbeaten run. As the underdogs, they have little to lose here and a win would extend a quite remarkable season.  Burnley vs Middlesbrough, Sky Bet Championship, Saturday 3.07pm They\'ve watched as Leicester City secured their return to the Premier League last weekend and now Burnley can follow suit if things go their way. Tuesday\'s 1-0 win at Barnsley, earned thanks to an Ashley Barnes goal early on, took them to the brink and a win at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday coupled with a Derby defeat by Huddersfield will see them home and hosed. \'The next game for us is a big one,\' manager Sean Dyche said after the match at Oakwell.\'We\'ve been focusing on it all season and that won\'t change.\'  Almost there: Sean Dyche and his Burnley team can secure promotion to the Premier League this weekend   Big winner: Ashley Barnes scored the decisive goal as Burnley beat Barnsley 1-0 in midweek to edge themselves to the brink of promotion   Going up: The top six in the Championship ahead of the weekend\'s matches  PROMOTION PERMUTATION Burnley will secure promotion this weekend if they beat Middlesbrough and Derby lose to Huddersfield. Two factors have taken Burnley into this strong position. A 10-game unbeaten run on the road - which included five wins - has proved their stamina on the final push for home. And their miserly defence has also helped - the tally of 34 goals conceded is the lowest in the Championship. The champagne is on ice but nothing is guaranteed against a Middlesbrough side who have won their last three. Their boss, Aitor Karanka, certainly doesn\'t want his players rolling over so the Lancashire side can enjoy their promotion party. \'It\'s a great game for us against Burnley who can be promoted this weekend but we will go there to win the game and not to celebrate their promotion,\' he said. \'We are there to play; we don\'t go to celebrate anything.\'  Party pooper: Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka is determined to spoil Burnley\'s afternoon   League One promotion race, Saturday 3.07pm This was the week in which, finally, we can safely assume that Wolves and Brentford will be the two sides going up automatically from League One. It\'s been a classic tussle, with Leyton Orient surging ahead and then being dragged back down, Brentford steadily building and Wolves coming from behind to storm clear. There was a brief late challenge from Rotherham but their loss at Sheffield United combined with Brentford\'s win over Crawley means a healthy gap of nine points has once again opened between second and third.  So close: Brentford took a big step towards reaching the Championship with a 1-0 midweek win over Crawley   Golden boys: Sam Ricketts celebrates with the Wolves fans after David Edwards put them two-up against Peterborough last time out   Two\'s company: Wolves and Brentford are odds-on favourites to go up automatically  Wolves have lost just twice since the turn of the year and last Saturday\'s 2-0 success over play-off chasing Peterborough took them to 90 points. Should they win at Crewe on Saturday they will practically be up, as will Brentford if they gain three points at Swindon. I watched Brentford\'s slender 1-0 win over Crawley on Tuesday night, one of those at the end of the season when the result is far more important than the performance. \'These are the hard games and we knew they were going to be a tough opponent,\' said Bees manager Mark Warburton afterwards. \'They slowed the game down and we had to respond to it and not get impatient.\'  Patience: As manager Mark Warburton acknowledged, Brentford had to play the waiting game before getting their winner against Crawley   Bad memories: Brentford suffered last minute heart-break last season when Doncaster pipped them to automatic promotion  It was telling, however, that despite the importance of the win, there were fairly muted celebrations in the stands at the end. Brentford\'s faithful are clearly still chastened by the horrendous experience of the final afternoon last year. But for them and Wolves, the party is most definitely coming soon.   Bristol Rovers vs Torquay United, Sky Bet League Two, Saturday 3.07pm While some can assure themselves of promotion this weekend, others are in the last chance saloon. Take Torquay United, in the League Two relegation zone for the last 19 games and yet, incredibly, still confident of avoiding the drop into non-league. After last Saturday\'s 1-0 defeat to title-chasing Scunthorpe United left them 10 points adrift with five matches to play, manager Chris Hargreaves insisted the great escape was still on.  Optimism: Torquay manager Chris Hargreaves still believes they can avoid relegation from the Football League   Tough ask: The Gulls find themselves 10 points adrift of safety at the foot of League Two with five games left  TORQUAY\'S GREAT ESCAPE? April 12 Bristol Rovers (A)April 18 Dagenham (H)April 21 Exeter City (A)April 26 Mansfield (A)May 3 Wycombe (H) He told BBC Radio Devon: \'Of course we can get out of this - five wins. I\'ll keep fighting, the players will keep fighting and we know that the fans are behind us.\' You have to admire his optimism and to be fair, he wouldn\'t be much of a manager if he threw in the towel. One encouraging thing for the Gulls is that three of their remaining five games come against sides in the bottom five of the table. On the other hand, they could be relegated by defeat at Bristol Rovers on Saturday if results elsewhere go against them.  Luton Town vs Braintree Town, Skrill Premier, Saturday 12.52pm, BT Sport 1 And should Torquay go down, we could know their replacement by Saturday evening. There will be a cracking atmosphere in front of the TV cameras at Kenilworth Road when Luton Town welcome Braintree Town on Saturday lunchtime knowing three points will secure their return to the Football League after four years away. The Skrill Premier is a notoriously tough division, packed with former League sides, but the Hatters have absolutely dominated and enjoy a 16-point lead.  On the up: Pelly Ruddock-Mpanzu scores for Luton against Dartford last week. They could secure promotion back to the Football League this weekend   All smiles: John Still has guided Luton back into the League after four seasons away  Manager John Still, who guided Maidstone United up from this division in 1989 and Dagenham into the League in 2007, is poised to make it a hat-trick. Luton also look good to reach both a century of goals (currently on 93) and points (92) in their four remaining games.  Scottish Cup Semi-final weekend It\'s semi-final time north of the border as well, with one tie on Saturday and the other on Sunday. Both will be staged at Ibrox, since Hampden Park is currently being revamped for the Commonwealth Games, and that has been a source of controversy ever since Rangers squeezed past Albion Rovers to reach the final four. Dundee United, who have been drawn against the Gers (Saturday, 12.45pm, Sky Sports 2), demanded an equal share of tickets to counter-balance their opponent\'s home advantage.  All to play for: It\'s the Scottish Cup semi-finals this weekend with Rangers playing Dundee United and Aberdeen playing St Johnstone, both at Ibrox   Blow: Rangers were shell-shocked after Raith Rovers beat them in the final of the Ramsdens Cup last Sunday  Rangers have sold 20,000 tickets so far, and the Tangerines half that, but former Dundee United man Jon Daly insists his Rangers team will enjoy no benefits. \'It\'s a one off game, so I don\'t think the venue really matters. It\'s a grass pitch and there are going to be 22 players, so that\'s all that\'s important,\' he said. Besides, Rangers aren\'t in the best frame of mind after a surprise defeat by Raith Rovers in the Ramsdens Cup final last weekend.  Neutral: Rangers striker Jon Daly insists playing at Ibrox will not necessarily benefit the Gers when they take on Dundee United   Confident: St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright is sure his team can upset Aberdeen and reach the final  On Sunday, Aberdeen are favourites against St Johnstone in the other semi-final (12.45pm, BBC Two Scotland and Sky Sports 2). The Dons have won three out of the four SPFL encounters this season but Saints boss Tommy Wright remains confident of a Cupset. \'If we look at the games we\'ve played against them, we know we can do better,\' he said. \'Hopefully we can do that on Sunday.\'  La Liga title race They\'ve locked horns in Europe this week, with Atletico Madrid getting the better of Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. And now they resume their slow-burning La Liga title battle alongside Real Madrid, with all three contenders having favourable fixtures this weekend.  Changing of the guard: Koke and David Villa celebrate what proved to be the winning goal for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in the week   Stunned: Lionel Messi was left dumbstruck after Barcelona failed to get through to the semi-finals  Barcelona, chastened from their European exit but nonetheless just one point off the summit, travel to Granada (Saturday, 7pm, Sky Sports 2). Straight afterwards, Real are in Bernabeu action against Almeria as they bid to close their three-point gap to their city rivals (9pm, Sky Sports 2). With both likely to win, the onus is then on Atletico, at Getafe on Sunday night (6pm, Sky Sports 1).  Bread and butter: It\'s back to the La Liga title push for Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale after successfully negotiating the challenge of Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League    Bayern Munich vs Borussia Dortmund, Bundesliga, Saturday 5.30pm, BT Sport 1 The Bundesliga title may already have been concluded - a whopping 20 points separate these two rivals - but Borussia Dortmund can maybe whack a few dents in Bayern\'s mighty armour as the season reaches the fag end. Pep Guardiola paid the price for resting key players ahead of the Champions League clash with Manchester United when they lost to Augsburg, snapping their 53-game unbeaten league run.  We\'re through: Bayern Munich suffered a scare but ultimately prevailed against Manchester United to reach the final four of the Champions League   Not enough: Robert Lewandowski and Borussia Dortmund came up just short against Real Madrid  But they recovered their poise with a clinical performance against United and all talk of a crisis was dispelled. Dortmund were impressive in beating Real Madrid 2-0 but were unable to grab the additional goals to overturn their first leg deficit. With plenty of talent on show, this game never fails to disappoint.   More... Bumming around!

As he put the final touches to Pacquaio\'s preparations for Saturday\'s rematch with Tim Bradley, Roach said: \'It looked close two years ago but I don\'t think Floyd will take the chance now.\'  Re-match: Manny Pacquiao faces undefeated WBO welterweight champion Tim Bradley on Saturday  More... Pacquiao sets sights on Mayweather and Marquez after revenge against Bradley Abuse after Pacquiao fight nearly drove me to suicide, says Bradley ahead of rematch Pacquiao dismisses Bradley\'s claim he has lost killer instinct ahead of rematch British referee Keane forced out of huge Pacquiao-Bradley rematch with sickness The PacMan versus the Money Man is still the fight the whole world wants to see but Roach doubts it will happen now Mayweather is so close to ending his career undefeated. He says: \'Floyd\'s main concern has become keeping that 0 (for zero losses) on his record. I don\'t see him taking any real risk of losing that before the end of next year, when he says he\'s retiring. \'It\'s not that he\'s afraid of Manny. No fighters are scared of anybody in the world. It\'s just that he believes if he goes out undefeated he will be seen as better than greats like Sugar Ray Robinson, who had losses on their records. Floyd Mayweather core strengthening ahead of Maidana bout  Undefeated: But Floyd Mayweather plans to retire next season  \'Manny and Floyd should have happened a couple of years ago when both were in their prime. I think Mayweather wanted the fight then. Later when we put them on the phone together Floyd said he wanted blood testing and 60 per cent of the money. \'Manny said yes to both but then we never heard back from Floyd again.\' The failure to make the super-fight happen has been blamed by some on the long-running feud between rival promoters Bob Arum (Pacquiao) and Golden Boy (Mayweather). But Roach said: \'Down the years, no matter what the issues, if two fighters really want to fight each other they maks it happen. Manny will fight anyone but Floyd is two years older and thinking about that record of his.  Doubts: Pacquiao\'s trainer Freddie Roach  \'Also we all get older and the first sign of aging in a fighter is that his legs go a little. After he got hit a lot by Miguel Cotto he said that he decided to stand and trade because he wanted to give more excitement to his fans. I don\'t think so.  He got caught because he can no longer move around the ring as quickly as before.\' Mayweather follows Pacquiao into the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas next month, for the third bout in his $300 million six-fight contract with the Showtime cable TV network. Roach is unsurprised that he opted at the last moment to box Marcos Maidana rather than the young, fast Amir Khan and he expects Mayweather to make sensible choices for his final three fights, one in September and two next year. The last, outside chance for the prize-ring\'s most climactic night of all hangs on Mayweather\'s finale, when he hopes to equal Rocky Marciano\'s record of retiring unbeaten after 49 fights.

On April 30, 2003, I wrote a column in The Times that said Sam Allardyce should be the Manager of the Year for keeping Bolton Wanderers up, but actually I hoped they went down. The reason I gave was that Bolton’s team was built around foreign loan signings, while the other threatened team, West Ham United, had some of the best young English players in the country. Sam thinks I’ve had it in for him ever since. I don’t think he remembers the praise in the piece and he took it personally, rather than as a commentary on the loan system. Since then, I’ve written repeatedly about temporary transfers, the stockpiling of players by major clubs, the whole dodgy area of gentlemen’s agreements and mates lending to mates, and the way football could be, if we would only wean ourselves off this devalued process. Not just in Premier League football, either. I wrote about Watford in the Championship last season, and Parma in Serie A this year. I wrote about Ryman League clubs Ware and Waltham Forest with more than 100 players passing through their books in one season, and Hameur Bouazza who in 2008-09 season played for Charlton Athletic against Birmingham City and Birmingham City against Charlton Athletic, while actually being owned by a third club, Fulham.  Sensitive soul: Sam Allardyce (left) kept Bolton up in 2003 with a number of loan players  And on Wednesday I wrote about the positive impact loans have had on Everton’s season and how this would appear incompatible with financial fair play and the way it clamps down on overspending clubs for artificially inflating their league position. Had Everton bought all of their squad this season they may have fallen foul of FFP, but with loans they get around the system. That is not right, surely. It is just inflation by another means. Doing so, just as I did 11 years ago, I made sure to make clear that the club had done nothing wrong, and the system was at fault. I praised Everton’s manager, Roberto Martinez and his chairman Bill Kenwright. I said I wanted Everton to finish top four, and it would be a welcome change. It turns out Big Sam is not the only sensitive soul in the Premier League. It turns out he is not the only one who consumes his news selectively, with a well-balanced chip on each shoulder. Debate about the incompatibility of FFP and the loan system? Zip. People thinking I had a pop at their club. Everybody. So, for the last time: I like Everton, I want Everton to do well. I don’t like the loan system. I think we would be better off without it. Oh, what the hell. Here’s the column if you can be bothered to read it. Judging by what follows, you won’t be alone if you can’t.  Why does everyone think this is a new issue? Everton took Glen Keeley from Blackburn Rovers on loan in 1982 – that was 32 years ago. Everton, like Arsenal, send players out on loan, too. Last month Apostolos Vellios went on loan to Blackpool. It\'s part of the game and is essential for the development of young players. Ross Barkley was sent out on loan a number of times. This is a ridiculous non-issue. No-one cared about it for decades and now because one club does it well, everyone wants to have a moan. Darren K, Liverpool. To fill in the gaps, Everton have seven players out on loan, and Ross Barkley was loaned to Sheffield Wednesday in 2012 and Leeds United in 2013. Keeley played 32 minutes for Everton and was sent off in the Merseyside derby for fouling Kenny Dalglish. His loan came with the option of a permanent move that, unsurprisingly, did not come to fruition. None of this matters, of course. A long list of historic examples is not the same as a counter argument, Darren. More young players came through when the loan system was not used so voraciously by clubs because a manager had to make do with what he had rather than searching for quick solutions elsewhere. Are any of the loan players in the first-team at Everton young and British? No. So, potentially, they are blocking that path for young British players.  Loan stars: Borini, Lukaku, Kallstrom and Remy, with a proponent of the system, Sam Allardyce Jose Mourinho: Now is not the time to discuss Lukaku\'s future   At least they\'re happy with the system: Roberto Martinez (centre) and Romelu Lukaku (left) celebrate the on-loan striker\'s goal against Arsenal  Big clubs are able to buy up too much of the young talent pool so the clubs simply can\'t develop them all into first team players. The loan system was the answer, but banning them from playing against their parent club was always wrong. Ultimately, it should not be possible to loan to a club unless they\'re in a lower league. Players were developed perfectly well in the days when Football League players from Divisions Two to Four were largely the young, up and coming group and the big clubs had a much smaller youth squad. It was better for the youngsters, with more regular first team competition, and better for the other leagues. Usednurse, Scottish Borders. Modern football has whole teams with a core of loaned players, whereas four decades ago a loan was exactly that – a way of overcoming a short-term emergency, like having every full-back at the club injured, or a glorified trial with a view to a permanent move. Continental clubs had a very active long-term loan system and we copied it from them. Has it made our football better, or given more opportunities to young British players? Hardly. You miss the most glaring fact of all. All clubs can use the loan system, while not all can go and spend £100m at the drop of a hat. Support Grass Roots, Liverpool. I think you’re missing a glaring fact, actually. Without the loan system, clubs would not be able to stockpile players and transfer fees would come down, meaning Everton might be able to afford the likes of Romelu Lukaku, without it costing the earth. Now that’s a sound system. And so is this.  Let\'s imagine you\'re in a country where there is a huge gap in both income and wealth between a minority of rich and a majority of those who just about make ends meet. The poorer majority cannot survive without receiving more income and therefore need money to invest, but don\'t have the inherent wealth to do so. Your suggestion would be to ban banks lending money to the poor, thus cementing in place the existing distribution of income and wealth? The poor stay poor and the rich get richer? Astoundingly good logic. StevenNaismith, Liverpool. You left out one factor, Steven. Players. Your analogy does not work because football in this case does not conform to the rules of a market economy, because there is a human commodity in the middle of the bands of rich and poor. Without loans, the rich would be unable to stockpile players, who would sign short-term contracts, request transfers, or stay with their smaller club of origin, therefore forcing the costs down for the poor. I think there are also occasions where big clubs use strategic loans to strengthen lower-level teams and improve those chances against rival opposition. For example, Jose Mourinho might have calculated at the beginning of the season that if Lukaku could score against Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, it\'s almost like he is scoring for Chelsea. Billy Shears, Manchester. Quite right, Billy. Technically, Chelsea could stockpile goalkeepers, loan 10 of them out and ensure they will play more than half of their league games against a reserve goalkeeper. Loan players should be free to play against their parent club, as they do in UEFA tournaments - unless, like Chelsea, the parent club has inserted a clause making such a collision prohibitive. Meaning, that if they draw Atletico Madrid in this month\'s semi-final, or play them in the final, Chelsea get to choose the opposition goalkeeper. Now, isn\'t that healthy?  Here\'s the point: Everton could not afford Lukaku and Gareth Barry (right) so their current position is inflated Pardew: Remy, Lukaku and Barry were the best loan signings  All players should have an annual financial fair play value based on annualised expense such as wages, plus current transfer value based on the market. Gsyblue, Guernsey. Good idea, but whose ledger will it occupy? Are Chelsea liable for Lukaku, to stop further stockpiling, or is the cost placed with Everton, to curb the motivation of building a team around loans? So what kind of loans should Everton deal in - the Glazer kind which allowed them to buy Manchester United? Tom, London. Neither is healthy, Tom; yet both are accepted strategies in football business. Blaming the Glazers for using the rules is no different to blaming Everton. It appears that it is OK if your loan signings scrape survival in the Premier League but as soon as they start firing you towards the Champions League it is screwing the system? Poor article with undertones suggesting that Samuel is basically saying plucky little Everton should know their place and are knowingly cheating. MikeyEFC87, Liverpool. Don’t put words in my mouth Mike. I couldn’t have made my positive feelings for Everton clearer; in fact I went out of my way to praise them. As stated in the preamble, I have always spoken out against the loan system, at both ends of the league, and in the middle. If your loan signings scrape survival, that means you have stayed up at the expense of another club, with players that are not yours. And that isn’t right, either. In a column published on May 13, 2009, I made that point about Norwich City’s survival in the Championship with 12 loan signings in 2007-08. I notice how when Arsenal beat us in the FA Cup nothing was said, but as soon as we beat them convincingly in the league loans became a massive problem. The biggest issue with the transfer and loan market is that mega-rich clubs are overinflating prices. When managers complain maybe they should look at the reason why there are so many players loaned. Efcdan, Deeside. Sort of my point, Dan. That is why I said Everton were not to blame. They are exploiting a flawed system and a problem exacerbated by the wealthiest clubs.  Not to blame: Everton are exploiting a flawed system that allows them to loan Lukaku, Barry and Deufoleu    I find it interesting that people prefer to see stability in the managerial hot-seat but are OK with players being at three clubs in the space of a year like Wilfried Zaha. The big benefit of the loan system is to develop younger players, so should there be an age cap? Players like Gareth Barry have been around for years - if a club wants him, they know what they\'re getting. Tucky1919, Lincoln. I’d like to see the whole system abolished, Tucky, but if we’re talking reform an age cap would certainly be a start. So naughty Manchester City have bought a 16-year-old from Feyenoord, who previously would have made his name at that club? Undoubtedly, this is a harmful trend for smaller clubs, but is it all the fault of FFP and Michel Platini? Newsflash, this has been happening for years. Teams like Chelsea and Arsenal have been shopping in youth academies in the Netherlands and Feyenoord have been losing their greatest talents, just like Ajax. It has nothing to do with FFP. Charles, Amsterdam. Yes, it has been a problem for many years but with financial fair play it is set to mushroom as clubs seek to circumvent the system. That was my point. Arsene Wenger wasn’t talking about stopping loans. He simply said that it is a shame players like Lukaku aren’t allowed to play against their teams. That makes sense, in my opinion. Khalid Ahmed, Oslo. Actually, he was talking about ending a substantial element of the loan system, Khalid. Here is what he said: \'I believe if you want to continue the loan system, we have to make the players available against the teams that loan them, or the system is not defendable. It\'s just a protection of the clubs who loan the players out to hurt the opponents and they have no risk at all. I think the best would be that the players are only loaned in lower divisions or abroad, and even abroad I\'m not completely convinced it is right.\' So Wenger would outlaw the loan transfers of Lukaku, Barry and Gerard Deulofeu in Everton’s case, as they are either in the same division or between major European clubs. He went a bit further than just saying they should be able to play against the parent club.  Bold move: Arsene Wenger would outlaw the loaning of players to teams in the same division  What does it matter? Is it more of a fairytale that Everton are bought out by a billionaire and given hundreds of millions to spend on success? Entrepreneur, Manchester. No – but let’s not pretend Bill Kenwright has not been seeking that option as a way out for his club. Indeed, he was castigated quite viciously by some Everton fans for being unable to find a wealthy buyer. It is called financial management, well within the fair play rules. As a football fan, would you rather Lukaku was on the bench at Chelsea, or playing week in, week out, at Everton? Loan transfers are not exactly free and some fail to work out, like Victor Moses at Liverpool. Jambo Jambo, South Africa. Firstly, I didn’t say it was outside the rules, quite the opposite. Secondly, the choice shouldn’t be between the loan and the bench. How about Everton sign Lukaku permanently for realistic money – the third way that is never considered because we have the loan system. The main difference is that if a rich owner pulls the plug then a club still has to pay inflated wages and may get in financial trouble. When loans end a club would typically just not be as good. Thomas, Watford. So their status has been artificially inflated, yes? Again, sort of my point. I feel the biggest flaw with the whole system is the amount of players a club is allowed to loan out. Fair enough with under-20’s gaining first-team experience in competitive football but above that there should be a strict limit. If a club was only allowed to loan out five players over 21 then players and agents would have to take that into account. Rot in the reserves or choose another team that offers more football. David, Southport. Once more, it’s a start David, albeit a rather generous one. Five over-21 loans per club? That’s 100 in the Premier League alone before we’ve even started on the stockpiled youth signings.  Temporary solution: Loic Remy has made a huge impact on Newcastle\'s season on loan from QPR  Your view of the loan system is flawed. Not all clubs can compete financially with the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea. Everton certainly can\'t, so without the loan system would probably be where they are, despite having impressive youngsters and England internationals such as Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Ross Barkley. They also have internationals from South Africa and the United States. So, if you are happy to keep the same few teams challenging for honours take away the loan system. If you prefer the most amazing competitive league keep it and allow smaller teams to compete. Don\'t blame Everton, applaud them for using the system well. Bye Bye Venkys, Preston. Everton has international footballers on permanent contracts? Big deal. So does every club. Don’t you see, it is the loan system that keeps clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea empowered and transfer fees high. Take it away and Everton could afford the players that are beyond them – just as it was in the old days. Unless you know any other time in football when Everton could not afford to buy Chelsea’s reserve striker or an aging midfield player that could not get in Manchester City’s team, and needed to make a temporary arrangement? Because I don’t. While I agree that we are lucky to have Lukaku, some of our top players this season have been Steven Naismith, James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman, Barkley and Baines. Not a loan player in sight. Please reanalyse Everton\'s season based on the whole team instead of trying to cast us as lucky one-timers. Lucy27, Chester. Lucy, I didn’t analyse Everton’s season, beyond praising them. I analysed the loan system, an aspect of football I was writing about when Lukaku was nine.  The same deal: Fabio Borini is on loan at Sunderland from Liverpool  So, basically, this loan system, which has been in place since I can remember in the Seventies and Eighties, is only flawed because it is working in our favour? Lukaku and Barry have been excellent, Deulofeu great in bits but hardly a regular. So is it Everton’s fault that Moses and others have not been as successful? All the top clubs throughout the Premier League and Europe use the loan system. Barry would be a substitute at best for City, Lukaku likewise at Chelsea and Deulofeu would be in Barcelona\'s B team, so is this not down to Martinez and his good management skills rather than a flawed loan system? Seems the media are worried about Everton gatecrashing the Champions League and denying Sky’s favoured clubs the extra cash and spending power. Dave EFC, Liverpool. Oh, get a grip and read the column. \'Roberto Martinez has done an outstanding job… an extraordinary feat and great for the English game…a new club breaking into the staid elite is always welcome…Everton are winning the popular vote… very smart in exploiting the nuances of the player market and good luck to them in that…\' It never ceases to amaze me, the circle the wagons, foolish paranoia, that is the default mechanism of many fans faced with even the mildest criticism of his club. I have been writing about the flaws, inconsistences, danger and weaknesses of the loan system for many years now. There is no point illustrating this argument using failed deals or mid-table clubs of no consequence. The harmful effects of the loan system are most keenly felt when a major issue is directly influenced – such as relegation, promotion or qualification to the Champions League. Bolton Wanderers staying up in 2003 was another example. Is that so hard to comprehend? I suppose Arsenal picking up Mikel Arteta, a key player for Everton, was fair game just because they could pay for him. Freespeechman, Liverpool. Yes, like when Everton bought Leighton Baines or James McCarthy from Wigan Athletic, Phil Jagielka from Sheffield United or Joleon Lescott from Wolverhampton Wanderers. Same thing.  Rarely seen: Kim Kallstrom has barely featured on loan at Arsenal  The loan system is designed to even the gap between the mega-rich and the other clubs and to give young players game time. Upthetofees, Wirral. No it isn’t. If the richest clubs thought any gap was truly being closed they would vote against it. The loan system is there because it allows the wealthy to keep overinflated squads and the poor to feed off their scraps. Usually, it only influences relegation and mid-table issues so the elite do not care; this season it may play a part in Champions League qualification. It will be interesting to see what happens next season. By being so good, Everton may have spoiled it for everyone. Give over, Coleman, McCarthy and Barkley have arguably contributed more than Barry and Deulofeu was out injured for months. Do you even watch the games? Daninjapan, Tokyo. Yes, and live, not just on television. Anyway, how are things at Shimizu S-Pulse? Is it more immoral utilising a completely legal loan system for a locally ran team, or spending half a billion on foreign players and leaving your academy out in the cold, with Arab money? Answer me that. Everton tend to loan a couple players every season due to lack of funds. Why have you just spoken up now? Because it\'s been a success? Where were you when Jo, Segundo Castillo and Matteo Ferrari came in? MHartley93, Liverpool. I was writing negative articles about the loan system, mate, which you obviously weren’t reading because unless the word Everton appears in the headline you’re probably not interested. Here’s the conclusion from that column about Bolton in 2003. \'I fear the influx of a league of Boltons, of managers who take the notion of a Player of the Month rather too literally, of talent that is borrowed as casually as next-door\'s power drill by bosses not as worldly-wise as Sam Allardyce. My concern is that when Allardyce\'s magic stops working - as one day it must, just as Wimbledon fell off the tightrope, and Lennie Lawrence couldn\'t save Charlton Athletic for ever - nothing will remain of what once was a great English football club. All there will be is people trying on Bolton shirts.\' So there are my credentials in writing about loans: 11 years of solid disapproval. I’m not sure you can find my old Times stuff online any more. So here (and here) are just a couple of links from the last two seasons. If Everton get Champions League football they can afford to buy Lukaku and Deulofeu. Manred1905, London. And I hope they do. But would Chelsea sell now Everton are a threat?  Potential benefit: By scoring in the Champions league, Joel Campbell could have done parent club Arsenal a favour  This difference is that Everton play in the same league as Chelsea. Arsenal are not in the Greek Super League and don\'t benefit when their loaned players can\'t play against them. Lukaku should have been in the Everton team versus Chelsea. That\'s the difference. GRB, Chandra. So the teams that Joel Campbell helped remove from the Champions League didn’t potentially benefit Arsenal? If we want to talk about unfair perhaps we need to mention the fact that teams such as Manchester United are able to spend £37m on one player during a transfer window? The transfer system must be revised with no deals taking place during the season. This may also place greater value on youth players. Pablo78, Liverpool. They bought the player with their own money, Pablo. Why is this unfair? Maybe if the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool had B teams like in Spain then these players wouldn’t be so freely available on loan. It would also help with developing English kids. Steven, Liverpool. I agree, Steven. A strong B-team league would definitely help. What about the players’ point of view? Lukaku was loaned to West Bromwich Albion last season where he was very successful. With the World Cup this summer he obviously wants to play as often as possible, and would not have been picked having spent two seasons as a substitute at Chelsea. Andy, Bridport. Andy, I can see what is in it for Lukaku, for Everton and for Chelsea – I just don’t think it is in the wider interests of the game. Never have.  Thumbs up: Manchester United bought Juan Mata with their own money, which is absolutely fine  This article is very harsh on Everton. How can you blame them for loaning players? Every other club does it. DBO-LFC, Liverpool. \'So let’s start by saying that the club challenging Arsenal for fourth place has done nothing wrong.\' Maybe I should have made it clearer. ‘The club challenging Arsenal for fourth place’? The one I said had ‘done nothing wrong’? That’s Everton. Short of writing in capital letters, maybe crayon, I don’t know what more I can do here. No mention of how well the £12m signing McCarthy has played, how Coleman and Baines look revitalised, or praise for blooding a 19-year-old in big games. Sie2003, Stafford. Yes, completely ignored, unless you include that oblique statement about Martinez doing \'an outstanding job\'. No-one moaned last season when Lukaku was at West Brom, but then again the media don\'t like Everton rocking the Premier League boat, unsettling their chosen few teams who should win everything every season. Petedil, Liverpool. Nobody is moaning. The reason Lukaku made less of a ripple at West Brom was because his presence made the difference between upper mid-table and lower mid-table so, basically, no difference at all. Surely you can appreciate why his impact at Everton is attracting more attention? And don’t give me that cobblers about wanting to see the same teams win all the time. One of the reasons I am so opposed to financial fair play is because it cements the elite in place. I think Everton have done a great job this season. I hope they snatch that fourth place. But I worry what they will do when Lukaku is gone. Take away his goals and where would they be? Ryan Smith, Newtown. Right, so let’s project. Say Everton qualify for the Champions League, which most people hope they do. Then Chelsea take Lukaku back. Unless Martinez is incredibly astute in the transfer market, Everton’s potential will be reduced. They may fail to make it through the preliminary rounds or go out at group stage – considering they are sure to be seeded in pot four. That then has a negative impact on the English game through co-efficient points. The leagues that have relied most heavily on loan trading are the ones that have gradually lost their Champions League berths – Italy for instance. Why, because teams qualify with an artificial squad list, are then weakened the following season and fall short. There has to be a better way.  One and only: Henrik Larsson scores his solitary league goal while on loan at Manchester United  So when Henrik Larsson scored a raft of goals to win Manchester United the league whilst on loan – that was OK then? Pavlos, Wigan. No it wasn’t. But just to stop you making a fool of yourself in the pub as well as on this forum, the stack of league goals scored by Larsson during his loan spell in 2006-07 amounted to one. The 70th minute third goal in a 4-0 home win over Watford. They probably would have managed it without him. You are basing the progress of a team on the input of a few players. It is like saying take Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard out of the Liverpool line-up and they wouldn\'t be where they are. And it\'s true, on both counts – but that shouldn\'t take the achievement away. TheHumbleEgg, Liverpool. Well, yes it should in one way, because those Liverpool players belong to the club, in Gerrard’s case since his schooldays, while the Everton trio are passing through on temporary arrangements. I do like it, though, when a people comprehensively undermine their own arguments. Makes my job a lot easier – and reminds me a little of this.  Maybe a better story would have been how Arsenal got wellied by a team costing less than Mesut Ozil. Jmcd, London. Except it didn’t really, did it? In these days of FFP, the true cost of a team is made illusionary because of the loan system. That’s the point. As a Toffee, this is more about Lukaku in my view and the fact that super-rich clubs like Chelsea are the real beneficiaries as they loan out almost 30 potential first team players. Everton have been made the focus of how the loan system is wrong when as usual it is the rich that are pulling the strings and have all the control. Everton may get Champions League but who will score the goals next season? We\'ll have to pay £25m or try to get another loan, but it\'s doubtful a top competing club in the Premier League would loan to a genuine rival. So maybe another club gets Chelsea\'s largesse. Meanwhile, Chelsea’s traditional rivals, such as Arsenal, miss out on UEFA’s money and it weakens their appeal in attracting top players. Who\'s the real beneficiary of that? Rich, Jersey. An Evertonian looking further ahead than May? You’ll be ducked as a witch, Rich. Yes, the loan players are important to Everton, but they\'re not everything. Lukaku hasn\'t been a 20 goals plus striker, Deulofeu is a squad player who has been used sparingly. What about our home grown talents of Barkley and John Stones, the resurgence of Leon Osman, the improvement of players like Kevin Mirallas and Naismith, the talent of our fantastic full backs and the solid central defensive partnership? Not forgetting Tim Howard\'s great season. Martinez should be judged on this and people will see that there\'s more to Everton than a couple of loan signings. Simon Smith, United Kingdom. Indeed there is Simon; but this is bigger than just a debate around one club. The fact that Everton have other good permanent players doesn’t suddenly validate the loan system. The two events are unrelated.  Unrelated: The fact Everton have good permanent players such as Kevin Mirallas doesn\'t validate the loan system  You can get loans in as long as you don\'t threaten to break into the media’s beloved top four. Luke, England. And what top four would that be, Luke? Does it include Manchester United, because they’re seventh right now? I know, I know. It’s tough when the facts don’t fit your stupid conspiracy theory. The defence have always been solid and the arrival of McCarthy has been a very shrewd move. Deulofeu has only been used a handful of times and Lukaku has been indifferent. Yet again it’s the same old story: little old Everton upsetting the Sky five, which we can’t have. Daleefc1878, Ipswich. Yes we talk of nothing else in press rooms. \'How are we going to stop Everton,\' we cry. How is this any different than clubs who just buy success? The team that Martinez inherited was already fantastic and he has just had to tweak it to his style of play. As for Everton struggling without Marouane Fellaini if we get into the Champions League, I doubt with the style of play we have now he would fit into the current squad. Gedi88, Liverpool. Ged, that is my argument. The two systems are imperfect, yet we have a holier-than-thou attitude to throwing money at a football club, while turning a blind eye to the artificial inflation via the loan system. I don’t blame Everton for using the part of the market that suits their needs; I just think there is a better way, and that it would benefit Everton long-term, too, by forcing prices down. And here’s another thought. Does Jack Rodwell leave if he knows he has to make Manchester City’s first-team to play, and cannot escape with a loan? Because I think, without the loan system, he is still your player. Maybe you would be better advised to look at the mega rich clubs who buy all the best players and then use naming rights to invest money and bypass the financial fair play rules. There is no level playing field out there, so stop whinging about our loans. J18efc00, Liverpool. I’m not whinging about your loans, but the loan system. I do find it comical, though, that people talk so piously about all other forms of advancement, except the one that benefits their club. No mention of the 27 Chelsea players out on loan then? More than the whole Everton squad. Sutty, St Helens. No, because I’ve written about them in previous columns. I try to make them different, you know. I find the regular readers prefer it.  Not the only one: Lukakau is one of many Chelsea players out on loan - a subject touched on in previous columns  Well done Everton. It\'s about time a club other than the Sky five broke into the closed shop of the media darlings. They have done it within the rules, rather than going out and spending millions on players, like Juan Mata in the transfer window. Goldfish1, Liverpool. This is really just another attack on teams who dare to threaten the status quo of Sky’s Big Four. If you\'re working within the system that is in place then that should be the end of it. Indeed, it could be argued that the loan system has evolved as a consequence of Sky throwing funds at football and the elite clubs over the last few years. They have been able to accumulate squads of expensive talent whilst others have been left to pick up the crumbs which fall from the top table, made worse with the oil money from wealthy foreign owners. Football used to be sport with a little bit of business; today it\'s a business, with a little bit of sport. Mark, Durham. Of course, some of us remember the original breakaway five in 1990: Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal – and Everton. So let’s drop all this nonsense about oligarchs and Arabs and poor little Everton. When Everton had the money and the power, they couldn’t wait to stuff everybody else and tried to cut the deal that ended in the formation of the Premier League. They were no different to the elite clubs now. And just because everyone keeps quiet and works within the system doesn’t mean it is correct. Slavery was a system; so was Stalinism. Come on Martin – Everton have lucked in to a great manager. Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all had their chance to appoint Martinez but Everton have an owner who lives and breathes football. Sadly, he has very little money compared to the big clubs, so Everton have used the loan system. Zipdip, Harwich. Look, I don’t want this debate to turn into an edition of Mystic Mart but the idea I haven’t given Martinez credit is beginning to jar. In this column from May 13 last year, I placed him among the names I thought Manchester City should have considered before Manuel Pellegrini. Here’s the quote: \'Could Pellegrini have won the FA Cup with Wigan Athletic, as Martinez did on Saturday? Could he have got Wigan playing better football than Manchester City? Yesterday’s FA Cup defeat may have come as a bit of a shock, the discovery that there is a Spanish manager playing better football and working tiny miracles 25 miles down the road.\' As for Bill Kenwright, I cannot think of a chairman I admire more. I would regard him as a friend and I hope that warmth came cross when I interviewed him for the paper on September 9, 2011, at a time when a group of Everton fans were campaigning to get him out.  Credit where it\'s due: Roberto Martinez has been given plenty of praise  This is nonsense. Financial fair play was brought in to stop clubs becoming overly indebted to their owners. By loaning high quality players Everton are reducing their financial risks. This is entirely consistent with the principles behind the FFP rules. Daiwaijai, Hong Kong. A loan player is not an asset. I am pretty sure FFP requires a club to develop its assets. And building success on temporary players did not exactly stand Bolton in good stead, long term. So it begins. How dare upstarts Everton get into top five? Stop bashing us - if you don’t like the loan system, speak to the Football Association. Steve, Liverpool. I would Steve, but they’re all cowering under the sofa in case someone mentions that Nicolas Anelka business again. If it gets them Champions League football and increased income to balance the books, it is not bad business. I prefer it to oil money. Alan, Liverpool. Yes, but why? Both are forms of artificial inflation. Why moralise around one but not the other? I seem to recall West Ham United loaned a certain Andrew Carroll and nothing was said. Michael, Liverpool. And the reason, Michael? Because Carroll’s presence had minimal impact. I don’t like the loan system; therefore I didn’t like Carroll’s loan to West Ham or any of the loans the club has arranged this season. QED. I don\'t care. If it\'s right that teams like Manchester City and Chelsea can be bought overnight and transformed into league dominating outfits, I think it\'s only fair that clubs who struggle to attract huge investment can find alternative methods of making the league more competitive. Rchappy88, Burnley. Yes, but it’s on their terms. Don’t you get it? This competition exists only on conditions set by the very clubs you deplore. If Everton start to challenge Chelsea, do you think they’ll get any more players? If Brendan Rodgers wasn’t Jose Mourinho’s mate, and Liverpool seen as mostly harmless, would they have got Victor Moses? Say Moses was a roaring success and was stopping a loan-free Everton team full of local talent coming fourth right now? Is it fair that who you know, or whose back you scratch, gets you a player? I wonder if Mourinho would have loaned out Moses and Lukaku if they could have played against him like they can in the Spanish and German leagues? Arsène, Finsbury Park. Short answer: no. You wrote: \'Barry, a squad player at Manchester City and now 33, but even so he might have commanded £6m as a permanent transfer in the summer.\' Barry is out of contract this summer and was offered to Everton for £1m in January. God only knows where you\'re getting £6m from. PJC83, Warrington. Because January isn’t the summer. Come on mate, we did the months of the year in primary school. What you are saying is that you want the Sky Four as it once was to always be on top. Everton cannot compete financially with most clubs but actually have the best manager. This seems to upset you for some reason. You should applaud Everton and what we\'ve done, upsetting the chosen few. Good coaching actually improves players like Barry, Lukaku and Deulofeu. God help us if Everton actually win the Champions League. Who are you going to blame then? Trobbo66, Plano, Texas. I’m very sorry that you didn’t understand the column Robbo. You’re probably good at something else. Whittlin’ maybe. New rules that need to be implemented: Clubs can only allow players that live within 30 minutes drive of their training ground into the academy. Clubs are not allowed to have contact with players that live outside the catchment area. Clubs cannot tell a player to move to a certain area to comply with rule 1. Only players aged 21 and under can go out on loan. Maximum of three loan signings at each club. Reduce squad size to 23 and abolish the unlimited players under the age of 21 rule. Maximum of 18 players that are not from the club\'s academy allowed in the first team squad. Transfer of teenage players prohibited. Contracted players under the age of 20 cannot move to another club.  Clubs from each country can only sign overseas players that are within 350 miles of their country when they reach 21 years of age. Clubs can only sign players from countries beyond 350 miles when the player reaches 22 years of age. I hope Sepp Blatter reads this. Scott Shelby, Birmingham. Yeah, Scott. He’s a big fan of this column. In fact, he phoned in and requested this one.  Interesting point, but what do you expect clubs like Everton to do? Ignore the possibility of borrowing these players? The system is flawed but Everton must be congratulated for making the best of what is available to them. If they finish above United, even, I will be very impressed. Mick, Bergerac. Won’t we all, Mick? To answer your question, I expect Everton to carry on doing exactly what they are doing now. I would in their position. I took issue with the system, not the club. That is what has been missed here. Before even reading the comments I knew there would be several people, presumably Everton supporters, throwing a wobbly, thinking it\'s an attack on their club and playing the victim card. Read the article, it concerns the contradictions of modern football, and it\'s not the first time Martin Samuel has talked about the stupidity of FFP and the consequences for poorer clubs and players. From the elite staying the elite, to clubs hoarding young players or making nearly their whole first XI up from loans. Plastics Everywhere, United Kingdom. Ah, my hero. Thanks mate, whoever you are. Rather than concentrating on the fact Everton are doing very well but happen to have loaned a few players, how about using your journalistic skill to investigate comments made by the Premier League chief executive a few weeks ago concerning Manchester United’s fall from grace and how it could affect the league financially? Could this not be construed to mean that bigger clubs are being favoured on decisions? If this is the way the Premier League think then it could be open to corruption. El Bob, Liverpool. What, Bob, you mean use my journalistic skills to write about Richard Scudamore’s comments as I did two weeks ago? Try to keep up. Look at Watford last season, challenging all the way in the Championship because of the loan system, yet this season they are nowhere near the same standard because many of the players went back. Qwerty123, Brighton. And so close to promotion via the play-offs, too. Can you imagine? It would have been carnage had they got up and then the rules changed. I was accused of having it in for them, too, I seem to remember. Maybe I just don’t like the theme from Z Cars. Everton are well within the FA rulebook and they deserve all the plaudits they get. What if Lukaku and the rest had ended up at Arsenal and propelled them to the title? Would it have been right then? Saj, Manchester. No.  What a difference: Watford nearly got promoted last season with a raft of loan players  What a bitter and ignorant article. First of all, Everton are a club that has nine league titles, roughly the same as Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea combined. Only Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have finished in the top four of English football more times. Yes, football didn\'t begin in 1992 like some would lead you to believe, so Everton making fourth spot wouldn\'t exactly be a fairytale. We are not Wigan Athletic. Lukaku has scored 13 goals this year, so Everton are not relying on him like Liverpool are with Suarez, either. Our team is still built around our defence, where our attack starts. Rdsnuke, Liverpool. And your history is relevant to this debate how? Oh, I see you resent all these upstart clubs taking what you think is rightfully yours. And you think you should be able to claim it back, no matter how that is achieved, while patronising Wigan, the club that sold you two of your best players and helped groom your manager. Nice. No, football didn’t begin in 1992 mate. So once again, the five clubs whose threatened breakaway culminated in the formation of the Premier League: Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool – and Everton. Funny how this wasn\'t a problem for the ten years that Everton have utilised the loan system for players like Royston Drenthe. This is lazy journalism from someone who doesn\'t watch Everton enough to know that their most consistent performers have been ones they own. DailyTonedMail, Liverpool. No, that’s a lazy argument from someone who hasn’t followed my writing enough to realise that I’ve been detailing the shortcomings of the loan system for more than 10 years, using examples other than Everton. If the loan system was not in place, where would the likes of Lukaku and Deulofeu gain the valuable experience of playing in our Premier League? Everton have at least six young players out on loan to lower division teams getting regular game time and both the borrowing clubs and Everton are getting the benefit. If those players improve to the point that when they return to Everton, they can press for first team places. That is a win-win situation for all and needs to be left alone. Bluebyyou, Tonypandy. So maybe if Everton didn’t have to play Chelsea’s loan players, the Everton players that are out on loan might get a game. Then, maybe Lukaku would have signed for a club that gave him first team football because transfer fees would come down without a stockpiling elite inflating the market. Now there’s a real win-win. Coleman, loan? Baines, loan? Miralles, loan? McCarthy, loan? Stones, loan? Naismith, loan? Barkley, loan? Howard, loan? No. The team isn\'t just built on three players. BlueEFC, Liverpool. No, but it’s not built on eight, either. Wenger: eat, sleep, moan, repeat. llort, SW4. I like that. Very funny. A reference to this, for those didn’t get it. (There’s a bit of language near the start, so not for easily upset, although that does seem to apply to a lot of people on here today.)  As a Manchester City fan I\'m delighted that the so called Big Four is now becoming the Big Six or Seven. For far too long United, Liverpool and Arsenal dominated the Champions League places and then Chelsea came along and put a spanner in the works. City\'s emergence has caused that much angst amongst the elite that they had to dream up FFP in an attempt to retain the status quo. Fortunately, they haven\'t got the brains to get that right either. So, Toffees, enjoy every minute of this season, hope you only lose one more game (you know which one) but snatch that last Champions League spot. At least two teams every season are going to have to live with no Champions League qualification; it might as well be Arsenal who join United in the Europa League. David, Manchester. With obvious exceptions, most want Everton in the Champions League – or any new club really. I just think all clubs would have more chance if this loan system ended, so the wealthiest could no longer run squads of 40 with half out on loan, and those other good players were then spread through the league. Permanently. The loan system is far from ideal but it\'s a damn sight more honest that having some foreign billionaire with little real interest in the game descend from nowhere to transform a middle of the road club into a serious contender. Both Chelsea and Manchester City were nothing remarkable until they were able to buy success off the shelf. When their benefactors get bored they will undoubtedly return from where they came. It is because of clubs like Everton who do well through sheer hard work and shrewd management that we don\'t yet have the situation that exists in Scotland where two rich clubs win everything in sight every year and the rest make up the numbers. Clive59, Wigan. No, Clive, it’s because of Chelsea and City that we’re not Scotland. (And it’s one up there now, not two.) They are the only ones to break the domination of Manchester United and Arsenal. Take them away and we would have become a two club league the moment Blackburn Rovers faded. Players are currently on loan in the Premier League at Sunderland (five), Fulham (five), West Ham (four), Hull City (three), Stoke City (three), Aston Villa (two), Newcastle United (two). Don\'t hear you complaining about any of them, or is it because a team outside of the big money five are making the system work in their favour? Why not campaign for a squad cap if you want fairness? Say a maximum of 22 players or 27 for clubs in Europe. Oh that\'s right, because it wouldn\'t suit the money five who want to splash their billions to have the best players on their books. Everton never made the rules, we just operate within them and we should be applauded for making the best of a ridiculous system instead of being denigrated. BlueAidan, Liverpool. Did you just copy and paste those statistics, because they are far from complete? There’s the two I mentioned at Arsenal for a start. Why don’t I go through each club individually? Well, let’s say I wrote about John Guidetti and Oussama Assaidi at Stoke. The response would be simple. It doesn’t make any difference, these players are peripheral to the narrative of the Premier League season and Stoke are mid-table, affecting nobody. So to draw attention to the issue the loans have to be an extreme case (like Watford last season, or the current situation at Parma in Italy) or be having an impact on a major issue. Isn’t that obvious? As for your point about capping squad numbers, that already happens. Major clubs get around it with, guess what?  No difference: Oussama Assaidi has had minimal impact on the wider Premier League while on loan at Stoke  You are right again. I\'d much rather see Chelsea spend £32m on Willian just so Tottenham don\'t get him and £12m on Salah so Liverpool don\'t get him. Also there is no sham in United paying £37m for a Chelsea reserve to try and preserve their top four status because let’s face it everyone wants to see the same finish year after year. Are you the same Martin Samuel who last year was praising Queens Park Rangers for spending £22m on Loic Remy and Christopher Samba on unsustainable wages? That worked out well didn\'t it? Jez, Liverpool. Well, every time I watch Chelsea Willian is in the team, so I’d say there was more to that than spite. Same with Mohamed Salah, who is 21 and still a squad man, but is often on the bench. I didn’t actually use the word sham anywhere in the column, and certainly not about Everton, so I don’t think it applies to the Mata transfer any more than it applies to Everton buying McCarthy from Wigan. These were just January transfers and perfectly routine. As for Samba and Remy, I didn’t praise QPR, merely defended their right to have a go at getting out of trouble. Sadly, the club was too diseased for it to work. Even so, they got the transfer fee back for Samba while Remy is on loan at Newcastle, which I keep reading here is a fantastic opportunity for him to get first-team football and for a little club with an average gate of 50,365 owned by one of the five richest men in the country to get a striker they couldn’t otherwise afford. It’s a Christmas miracle, really. It is beginning to worry me that this spotlight is being shone on our loan players at this point of the season. Nobody cared about them last August when they first arrived and everyone was highly complementary towards Martinez for being astute enough to sign them. Now it seems that it\'s not OK because we might actually achieve something. This whole debate is begrudging. Dicey69, Ireland. Why are you worried? Everton have done nothing wrong. It’s not as if anyone could take fourth place from you if you got it. There is no conspiracy to deny your club anything. In fact, most neutrals – myself included – would be delighted if Everton got top four this season. The praise for Martinez and Kenwright in their astute use of the loan system in August remains. But I don’t like the system and never have. If Moses scores the winner in a game that clinches the title for Liverpool, should the goal be disallowed because he is on loan? Of course not. Colefc, Bootle. How about if he misses a sitter and Chelsea win the title, though; or refuses to play because he fears for his future at Stamford Bridge if that happened? What if we did away with a system that created these dilemmas, traded players like the old days and watched fees fall so that – the very cream of the crop aside – Everton could afford to buy who they damn well liked? And wouldn’t lose Rodwell to City because the player would know he might not make the first team and couldn’t be loaned out, so would be better off staying put. Until next time.   More...

On April 30, 2003, I wrote a column in The Times that said Sam Allardyce should be the Manager of the Year for keeping Bolton Wanderers up, but actually I hoped they went down. The reason I gave was that Bolton’s team was built around foreign loan signings, while the other threatened team, West Ham United, had some of the best young English players in the country. Sam thinks I’ve had it in for him ever since. I don’t think he remembers the praise in the piece and he took it personally, rather than as a commentary on the loan system.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Since then, I’ve written repeatedly about temporary transfers, the stockpiling of players by major clubs, the whole dodgy area of gentlemen’s agreements and mates lending to mates, and the way football could be, if we would only wean ourselves off this devalued process. Not just in Premier League football, either. I wrote about Watford in the Championship last season, and Parma in Serie A this year. I wrote about Ryman League clubs Ware and Waltham Forest with more than 100 players passing through their books in one season, and Hameur Bouazza who in 2008-09 season played for Charlton Athletic against Birmingham City and Birmingham City against Charlton Athletic, while actually being owned by a third club, Fulham. </span><br/></font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Sensitive soul: Sam Allardyce (left) kept Bolton up in 2003 with a number of loan players\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"398\" id=\"i-a6490e5b\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-00640F5B00000258-266_634x398.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Sensitive soul: Sam Allardyce (left) kept Bolton up in 2003 with a number of loan players</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And on Wednesday I wrote about the positive impact loans have had on Everton’s season and how this would appear incompatible with financial fair play and the way it clamps down on overspending clubs for artificially inflating their league position. Had Everton bought all of their squad this season they may have fallen foul of FFP, but with loans they get around the system. That is not right, surely. It is just inflation by another means. Doing so, just as I did 11 years ago, I made sure to make clear that the club had done nothing wrong, and the system was at fault. I praised Everton’s manager, Roberto Martinez and his chairman Bill Kenwright. I said I wanted Everton to finish top four, and it would be a welcome change.</font></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It turns out Big Sam is not the only sensitive soul in the Premier League. It turns out he is not the only one who consumes his news selectively, with a well-balanced chip on each shoulder. Debate about the incompatibility of FFP and the loan system? Zip. People thinking I had a pop at their club. Everybody. So, for the last time: I like Everton, I want Everton to do well. I don’t like the loan system. I think we would be better off without it. Oh, what the hell. <a href=\"/sport/football/article-2599917/MARTIN-SAMUEL-Everton-fairytale-hooked-shame-built-50m-loan-sham-Lukaku-Barry-Deulofeu-Wengers-right-moan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" target=\"_blank\">Here’s the column</a> if you can be bothered to read it. Judging by what follows, you won’t be alone if you can’t.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Why does everyone think this is a new issue? Everton took Glen Keeley from Blackburn Rovers on loan in 1982 – that was 32 years ago. Everton, like Arsenal, send players out on loan, too. Last month Apostolos Vellios went on loan to Blackpool. It\'s part of the game and is essential for the development of young players. Ross Barkley was sent out on loan a number of times. This is a ridiculous non-issue. No-one cared about it for decades and now because one club does it well, everyone wants to have a moan. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Darren K, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">To fill in the gaps, Everton have seven players out on loan, and Ross Barkley was loaned to Sheffield Wednesday in 2012 and Leeds United in 2013. Keeley played 32 minutes for Everton and was sent off in the Merseyside derby for fouling Kenny Dalglish. His loan came with the option of a permanent move that, unsurprisingly, did not come to fruition. None of this matters, of course. A long list of historic examples is not the same as a counter argument, Darren. More young players came through when the loan system was not used so voraciously by clubs because a manager had to make do with what he had rather than searching for quick solutions elsewhere. Are any of the loan players in the first-team at Everton young and British? No. So, potentially, they are blocking that path for young British players.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Loan stars: Borini, Lukaku, Kallstrom and Remy, with a proponent of the system, Sam Allardyce\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"439\" id=\"i-ab1e0e80\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CFD1C5400000578-806_634x439.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Loan stars: Borini, Lukaku, Kallstrom and Remy, with a proponent of the system, Sam Allardyce</p><div class=\"moduleFull\"><a class=\"namedLink\" name=\"video\"></a><div class=\"item\"> <div id=\"v-3430733408001\" style=\"width:636px;\"> <div class=\"videoplayer-large\" style=\"overflow-y:hidden\"> <a> <div class=\"videoplayer-title-bg\"></div> <div class=\"videoplayer-title\">Jose Mourinho: Now is not the time to discuss Lukaku\'s future</div> <div class=\"btnBg\"></div> <span class=\"playbtn\"></span> <center> <img class=\"plcHlder\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/04/video-undefined-1CD58CD400000578-46_636x358.jpg\"/> </center> </a> </div> <div class=\"sport\"> <div class=\"wocc videoplayer-keyline\"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"At least they\'re happy with the system: Roberto Martinez (centre) and Romelu Lukaku (left) celebrate the on-loan striker\'s goal against Arsenal\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"426\" id=\"i-a77d0e5d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CE2091400000578-791_634x426.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">At least they\'re happy with the system: Roberto Martinez (centre) and Romelu Lukaku (left) celebrate the on-loan striker\'s goal against Arsenal</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Big clubs are able to buy up too much of the young talent pool so the clubs simply can\'t develop them all into first team players. The loan system was the answer, but banning them from playing against their parent club was always wrong. Ultimately, it should not be possible to loan to a club unless they\'re in a lower league. Players were developed perfectly well in the days when Football League players from Divisions Two to Four were largely the young, up and coming group and the big clubs had a much smaller youth squad. It was better for the youngsters, with more regular first team competition, and better for the other leagues. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Usednurse, Scottish Borders. </span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Modern football has whole teams with a core of loaned players, whereas four decades ago a loan was exactly that – a way of overcoming a short-term emergency, like having every full-back at the club injured, or a glorified trial with a view to a permanent move. Continental clubs had a very active long-term loan system and we copied it from them. Has it made our football better, or given more opportunities to young British players? Hardly. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">You miss the most glaring fact of all. All clubs can use the loan system, while not all can go and spend £100m at the drop of a hat. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Support Grass Roots, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I think you’re missing a glaring fact, actually. Without the loan system, clubs would not be able to stockpile players and transfer fees would come down, meaning Everton might be able to afford the likes of Romelu Lukaku, without it costing the earth. Now that’s a sound system. And so is this.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/AILMVTf2AL8\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Let\'s imagine you\'re in a country where there is a huge gap in both income and wealth between a minority of rich and a majority of those who just about make ends meet. The poorer majority cannot survive without receiving more income and therefore need money to invest, but don\'t have the inherent wealth to do so. Your suggestion would be to ban banks lending money to the poor, thus cementing in place the existing distribution of income and wealth? The poor stay poor and the rich get richer? Astoundingly good logic. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">StevenNaismith, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">You left out one factor, Steven. Players. Your analogy does not work because football in this case does not conform to the rules of a market economy, because there is a human commodity in the middle of the bands of rich and poor. Without loans, the rich would be unable to stockpile players, who would sign short-term contracts, request transfers, or stay with their smaller club of origin, therefore forcing the costs down for the poor.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I think there are also occasions where big clubs use strategic loans to strengthen lower-level teams and improve those chances against rival opposition. For example, Jose Mourinho might have calculated at the beginning of the season that if Lukaku could score against Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, it\'s almost like he is scoring for Chelsea. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Billy Shears, Manchester.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Quite right, Billy. Technically, Chelsea could stockpile goalkeepers, loan 10 of them out and ensure they will play more than half of their league games against a reserve goalkeeper. Loan players should be free to play against their parent club, as they do in UEFA tournaments - unless, like Chelsea, the parent club has inserted a clause making such a collision prohibitive. Meaning, that if they draw Atletico Madrid in this month\'s semi-final, or play them in the final, Chelsea get to choose the opposition goalkeeper. Now, isn\'t that healthy?<br/></font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <div class=\"splitLeft\"> <img alt=\"Here\'s the point: Everton could not afford Lukaku\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"423\" id=\"i-a8800e5e\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CE218C300000578-710_306x423.jpg\" width=\"306\"/> </div> <div class=\"splitRight\"> <img alt=\"One of many: Gareth Barry has been marginalised at Manchester City because of their huge squad\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"423\" id=\"i-a9f00e71\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CE21B2D00000578-377_306x423.jpg\" width=\"306\"/> </div> <div class=\"clear\"> </div> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Here\'s the point: Everton could not afford Lukaku and Gareth Barry (right) so their current position is inflated<br/></p><div class=\"moduleFull\"><div class=\"item\"> <div id=\"v-3385493677001\" style=\"width:636px;\"> <div class=\"videoplayer-large\" style=\"overflow-y:hidden\"> <a> <div class=\"videoplayer-title-bg\"></div> <div class=\"videoplayer-title\">Pardew: Remy, Lukaku and Barry were the best loan signings</div> <div class=\"btnBg\"></div> <span class=\"playbtn\"></span> <center> <img class=\"plcHlder\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/03/24/video-undefined-1C890F9100000578-398_636x358.jpg\"/> </center> </a> </div> <div class=\"sport\"> <div class=\"wocc videoplayer-keyline\"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">All players should have an annual financial fair play value based on annualised expense such as wages, plus current transfer value based on the market. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Gsyblue, Guernsey.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Good idea, but whose ledger will it occupy?

Poor article with undertones suggesting that Samuel is basically saying plucky little Everton should know their place and are knowingly cheating. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MikeyEFC87, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Don’t put words in my mouth Mike. I couldn’t have made my positive feelings for Everton clearer; in fact I went out of my way to praise them. As stated in the preamble, I have always spoken out against the loan system, at both ends of the league, and in the middle. If your loan signings scrape survival, that means you have stayed up at the expense of another club, with players that are not yours. And that isn’t right, either. In a column published on May 13, 2009, I made that point about Norwich City’s survival in the Championship with 12 loan signings in 2007-08.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I notice how when Arsenal beat us in the FA Cup nothing was said, but as soon as we beat them convincingly in the league loans became a massive problem. The biggest issue with the transfer and loan market is that mega-rich clubs are overinflating prices. When managers complain maybe they should look at the reason why there are so many players loaned. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Efcdan, Deeside.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Sort of my point, Dan.

The big benefit of the loan system is to develop younger players, so should there be an age cap? Players like Gareth Barry have been around for years - if a club wants him, they know what they\'re getting. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Tucky1919, Lincoln.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I’d like to see the whole system abolished, Tucky, but if we’re talking reform an age cap would certainly be a start.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So naughty Manchester City have bought a 16-year-old from Feyenoord, who previously would have made his name at that club? Undoubtedly, this is a harmful trend for smaller clubs, but is it all the fault of FFP and Michel Platini? Newsflash, this has been happening for years. Teams like Chelsea and Arsenal have been shopping in youth academies in the Netherlands and Feyenoord have been losing their greatest talents, just like Ajax. It has nothing to do with FFP. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Charles, Amsterdam.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, it has been a problem for many years but with financial fair play it is set to mushroom as clubs seek to circumvent the system. That was my point.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Arsene Wenger wasn’t talking about stopping loans. He simply said that it is a shame players like Lukaku aren’t allowed to play against their teams. That makes sense, in my opinion. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Khalid Ahmed, Oslo.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Actually, he was talking about ending a substantial element of the loan system, Khalid. Here is what he said: \'I believe if you want to continue the loan system, we have to make the players available against the teams that loan them, or the system is not defendable. It\'s just a protection of the clubs who loan the players out to hurt the opponents and they have no risk at all. I think the best would be that the players are only loaned in lower divisions or abroad, and even abroad I\'m not completely convinced it is right.\' So Wenger would outlaw the loan transfers of Lukaku, Barry and Gerard Deulofeu in Everton’s case, as they are either in the same division or between major European clubs. He went a bit further than just saying they should be able to play against the parent club. <br/></font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Bold move: Arsene Wenger would outlaw the loaning of players to teams in the same division\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"399\" id=\"i-ab000e82\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CE26AE700000578-260_634x399.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Bold move: Arsene Wenger would outlaw the loaning of players to teams in the same division</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">What does it matter? Is it more of a fairytale that Everton are bought out by a billionaire and given hundreds of millions to spend on success? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Entrepreneur, Manchester.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No – but let’s not pretend Bill Kenwright has not been seeking that option as a way out for his club. Indeed, he was castigated quite viciously by some Everton fans for being unable to find a wealthy buyer.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It is called financial management, well within the fair play rules. As a football fan, would you rather Lukaku was on the bench at Chelsea, or playing week in, week out, at Everton? Loan transfers are not exactly free and some fail to work out, like Victor Moses at Liverpool. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jambo Jambo, South Africa.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Firstly, I didn’t say it was outside the rules, quite the opposite. Secondly, the choice shouldn’t be between the loan and the bench. How about Everton sign Lukaku permanently for realistic money – the third way that is never considered because we have the loan system.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The main difference is that if a rich owner pulls the plug then a club still has to pay inflated wages and may get in financial trouble. When loans end a club would typically just not be as good. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Thomas, Watford.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So their status has been artificially inflated, yes? Again, sort of my point.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I feel the biggest flaw with the whole system is the amount of players a club is allowed to loan out. Fair enough with under-20’s gaining first-team experience in competitive football but above that there should be a strict limit. If a club was only allowed to loan out five players over 21 then players and agents would have to take that into account. Rot in the reserves or choose another team that offers more football. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">David, Southport.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Once more, it’s a start David, albeit a rather generous one. Five over-21 loans per club? That’s 100 in the Premier League alone before we’ve even started on the stockpiled youth signings.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Temporary solution: Loic Remy has made a huge impact on Newcastle\'s season on loan from QPR\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"641\" id=\"i-ae7b0e9c\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CFCFBB400000578-465_634x641.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Temporary solution: Loic Remy has made a huge impact on Newcastle\'s season on loan from QPR</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Your view of the loan system is flawed. Not all clubs can compete financially with the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea. Everton certainly can\'t, so without the loan system would probably be where they are, despite having impressive youngsters and England internationals such as Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Ross Barkley. They also have internationals from South Africa and the United States. So, if you are happy to keep the same few teams challenging for honours take away the loan system. If you prefer the most amazing competitive league keep it and allow smaller teams to compete. Don\'t blame Everton, applaud them for using the system well. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bye Bye Venkys, Preston.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Everton has international footballers on permanent contracts? Big deal. So does every club. Don’t you see, it is the loan system that keeps clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea empowered and transfer fees high. Take it away and Everton could afford the players that are beyond them – just as it was in the old days. Unless you know any other time in football when Everton could not afford to buy Chelsea’s reserve striker or an aging midfield player that could not get in Manchester City’s team, and needed to make a temporary arrangement? Because I don’t.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">While I agree that we are lucky to have Lukaku, some of our top players this season have been Steven Naismith, James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman, Barkley and Baines. Not a loan player in sight. Please reanalyse Everton\'s season based on the whole team instead of trying to cast us as lucky one-timers. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Lucy27, Chester.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Lucy, I didn’t analyse Everton’s season, beyond praising them.

Lukaku and Barry have been excellent, Deulofeu great in bits but hardly a regular. So is it Everton’s fault that Moses and others have not been as successful? All the top clubs throughout the Premier League and Europe use the loan system. Barry would be a substitute at best for City, Lukaku likewise at Chelsea and Deulofeu would be in Barcelona\'s B team, so is this not down to Martinez and his good management skills rather than a flawed loan system? Seems the media are worried about Everton gatecrashing the Champions League and denying Sky’s favoured clubs the extra cash and spending power. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dave EFC, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Oh, get a grip and read the column. \'Roberto Martinez has done an outstanding job… an extraordinary feat and great for the English game…a new club breaking into the staid elite is always welcome…Everton are winning the popular vote… very smart in exploiting the nuances of the player market and good luck to them in that…\' It never ceases to amaze me, the circle the wagons, foolish paranoia, that is the default mechanism of many fans faced with even the mildest criticism of his club. I have been writing about the flaws, inconsistences, danger and weaknesses of the loan system for many years now. There is no point illustrating this argument using failed deals or mid-table clubs of no consequence. The harmful effects of the loan system are most keenly felt when a major issue is directly influenced – such as relegation, promotion or qualification to the Champions League. Bolton Wanderers staying up in 2003 was another example. Is that so hard to comprehend? </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I suppose Arsenal picking up Mikel Arteta, a key player for Everton, was fair game just because they could pay for him. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Freespeechman, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, like when Everton bought Leighton Baines or James McCarthy from Wigan Athletic, Phil Jagielka from Sheffield United or Joleon Lescott from Wolverhampton Wanderers.

If the richest clubs thought any gap was truly being closed they would vote against it. The loan system is there because it allows the wealthy to keep overinflated squads and the poor to feed off their scraps. Usually, it only influences relegation and mid-table issues so the elite do not care; this season it may play a part in Champions League qualification. It will be interesting to see what happens next season. By being so good, Everton may have spoiled it for everyone.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Give over, Coleman, McCarthy and Barkley have arguably contributed more than Barry and Deulofeu was out injured for months. Do you even watch the games? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Daninjapan, Tokyo.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, and live, not just on television. Anyway, how are things at Shimizu S-Pulse?</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Is it more immoral utilising a completely legal loan system for a locally ran team, or spending half a billion on foreign players and leaving your academy out in the cold, with Arab money? Answer me that. Everton tend to loan a couple players every season due to lack of funds. Why have you just spoken up now? Because it\'s been a success? Where were you when Jo, Segundo Castillo and Matteo Ferrari came in? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">MHartley93, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I was writing negative articles about the loan system, mate, which you obviously weren’t reading because unless the word Everton appears in the headline you’re probably not interested. Here’s the conclusion from that column about Bolton in 2003. \'I fear the influx of a league of Boltons, of managers who take the notion of a Player of the Month rather too literally, of talent that is borrowed as casually as next-door\'s power drill by bosses not as worldly-wise as Sam Allardyce. My concern is that when Allardyce\'s magic stops working - as one day it must, just as Wimbledon fell off the tightrope, and Lennie Lawrence couldn\'t save Charlton Athletic for ever - nothing will remain of what once was a great English football club. All there will be is people trying on Bolton shirts.\' So there are my credentials in writing about loans: 11 years of solid disapproval. I’m not sure you can find my old Times stuff online any more.

Arsenal are not in the Greek Super League and don\'t benefit when their loaned players can\'t play against them. Lukaku should have been in the Everton team versus Chelsea. That\'s the difference. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">GRB, Chandra.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So the teams that Joel Campbell helped remove from the Champions League didn’t potentially benefit Arsenal?</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If we want to talk about unfair perhaps we need to mention the fact that teams such as Manchester United are able to spend £37m on one player during a transfer window? The transfer system must be revised with no deals taking place during the season. This may also place greater value on youth players. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pablo78, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">They bought the player with their own money, Pablo. Why is this unfair?</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Maybe if the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool had B teams like in Spain then these players wouldn’t be so freely available on loan. It would also help with developing English kids. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Steven, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I agree, Steven. A strong B-team league would definitely help.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">What about the players’ point of view? Lukaku was loaned to West Bromwich Albion last season where he was very successful. With the World Cup this summer he obviously wants to play as often as possible, and would not have been picked having spent two seasons as a substitute at Chelsea. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Andy, Bridport.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Andy, I can see what is in it for Lukaku, for Everton and for Chelsea – I just don’t think it is in the wider interests of the game.

The one I said had ‘done nothing wrong’? That’s Everton. Short of writing in capital letters, maybe crayon, I don’t know what more I can do here.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No mention of how well the £12m signing McCarthy has played, how Coleman and Baines look revitalised, or praise for blooding a 19-year-old in big games. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Sie2003, Stafford.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, completely ignored, unless you include that oblique statement about Martinez doing \'an outstanding job\'.  </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No-one moaned last season when Lukaku was at West Brom, but then again the media don\'t like Everton rocking the Premier League boat, unsettling their chosen few teams who should win everything every season. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Petedil, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Nobody is moaning. The reason Lukaku made less of a ripple at West Brom was because his presence made the difference between upper mid-table and lower mid-table so, basically, no difference at all. Surely you can appreciate why his impact at Everton is attracting more attention? And don’t give me that cobblers about wanting to see the same teams win all the time. One of the reasons I am so opposed to financial fair play is because it cements the elite in place. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I think Everton have done a great job this season. I hope they snatch that fourth place. But I worry what they will do when Lukaku is gone. Take away his goals and where would they be? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ryan Smith, Newtown.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Right, so let’s project. Say Everton qualify for the Champions League, which most people hope they do. Then Chelsea take Lukaku back. Unless Martinez is incredibly astute in the transfer market, Everton’s potential will be reduced. They may fail to make it through the preliminary rounds or go out at group stage – considering they are sure to be seeded in pot four. That then has a negative impact on the English game through co-efficient points. The leagues that have relied most heavily on loan trading are the ones that have gradually lost their Champions League berths – Italy for instance. Why, because teams qualify with an artificial squad list, are then weakened the following season and fall short. There has to be a better way.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"One and only: Henrik Larsson scores his solitary league goal while on loan at Manchester United\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"402\" id=\"i-a6530e53\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-0636B7160000044D-357_634x402.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">One and only: Henrik Larsson scores his solitary league goal while on loan at Manchester United</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So when Henrik Larsson scored a raft of goals to win Manchester United the league whilst on loan – that was OK then? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pavlos, Wigan.</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No it wasn’t. But just to stop you making a fool of yourself in the pub as well as on this forum, the stack of league goals scored by Larsson during his loan spell in 2006-07 amounted to one.

In these days of FFP, the true cost of a team is made illusionary because of the loan system. That’s the point.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">As a Toffee, this is more about Lukaku in my view and the fact that super-rich clubs like Chelsea are the real beneficiaries as they loan out almost 30 potential first team players. Everton have been made the focus of how the loan system is wrong when as usual it is the rich that are pulling the strings and have all the control. Everton may get Champions League but who will score the goals next season? We\'ll have to pay £25m or try to get another loan, but it\'s doubtful a top competing club in the Premier League would loan to a genuine rival. So maybe another club gets Chelsea\'s largesse. Meanwhile, Chelsea’s traditional rivals, such as Arsenal, miss out on UEFA’s money and it weakens their appeal in attracting top players. Who\'s the real beneficiary of that? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rich, Jersey.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">An Evertonian looking further ahead than May? You’ll be ducked as a witch, Rich.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, the loan players are important to Everton, but they\'re not everything. Lukaku hasn\'t been a 20 goals plus striker, Deulofeu is a squad player who has been used sparingly. What about our home grown talents of Barkley and John Stones, the resurgence of Leon Osman, the improvement of players like Kevin Mirallas and Naismith, the talent of our fantastic full backs and the solid central defensive partnership? Not forgetting Tim Howard\'s great season. Martinez should be judged on this and people will see that there\'s more to Everton than a couple of loan signings. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Simon Smith, United Kingdom.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Indeed there is Simon; but this is bigger than just a debate around one club.

It’s tough when the facts don’t fit your stupid conspiracy theory.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The defence have always been solid and the arrival of McCarthy has been a very shrewd move. Deulofeu has only been used a handful of times and Lukaku has been indifferent.

The team that Martinez inherited was already fantastic and he has just had to tweak it to his style of play. As for Everton struggling without Marouane Fellaini if we get into the Champions League, I doubt with the style of play we have now he would fit into the current squad. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Gedi88, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Ged, that is my argument. The two systems are imperfect, yet we have a holier-than-thou attitude to throwing money at a football club, while turning a blind eye to the artificial inflation via the loan system. I don’t blame Everton for using the part of the market that suits their needs; I just think there is a better way, and that it would benefit Everton long-term, too, by forcing prices down. And here’s another thought. Does Jack Rodwell leave if he knows he has to make Manchester City’s first-team to play, and cannot escape with a loan? Because I think, without the loan system, he is still your player.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Maybe you would be better advised to look at the mega rich clubs who buy all the best players and then use naming rights to invest money and bypass the financial fair play rules.

They have done it within the rules, rather than going out and spending millions on players, like Juan Mata in the transfer window. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Goldfish1, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">This is really just another attack on teams who dare to threaten the status quo of Sky’s Big Four. If you\'re working within the system that is in place then that should be the end of it. Indeed, it could be argued that the loan system has evolved as a consequence of Sky throwing funds at football and the elite clubs over the last few years. They have been able to accumulate squads of expensive talent whilst others have been left to pick up the crumbs which fall from the top table, made worse with the oil money from wealthy foreign owners. Football used to be sport with a little bit of business; today it\'s a business, with a little bit of sport. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mark, Durham.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Of course, some of us remember the original breakaway five in 1990: Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal – and Everton. So let’s drop all this nonsense about oligarchs and Arabs and poor little Everton. When Everton had the money and the power, they couldn’t wait to stuff everybody else and tried to cut the deal that ended in the formation of the Premier League. They were no different to the elite clubs now. And just because everyone keeps quiet and works within the system doesn’t mean it is correct. Slavery was a system; so was Stalinism.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Come on Martin – Everton have lucked in to a great manager. Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all had their chance to appoint Martinez but Everton have an owner who lives and breathes football. Sadly, he has very little money compared to the big clubs, so Everton have used the loan system. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Zipdip, Harwich.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Look, I don’t want this debate to turn into an edition of Mystic Mart but the idea I haven’t given Martinez credit is beginning to jar. In this column from May 13 last year, I placed him among the names I thought Manchester City should have considered before Manuel Pellegrini. Here’s the quote: \'Could Pellegrini have won the FA Cup with Wigan Athletic, as Martinez did on Saturday? Could he have got Wigan playing better football than Manchester City? Yesterday’s FA Cup defeat may have come as a bit of a shock, the discovery that there is a Spanish manager playing better football and working tiny miracles 25 miles down the road.\' As for Bill Kenwright, I cannot think of a chairman I admire more. I would regard him as a friend and I hope that warmth came cross when I interviewed him for the paper on September 9, 2011, at a time when a group of Everton fans were campaigning to get him out. <br/></font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Credit where it\'s due: Roberto Martinez has been given plenty of praise\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"344\" id=\"i-a88e0e65\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CE2411F00000578-840_634x344.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Credit where it\'s due: Roberto Martinez has been given plenty of praise</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">This is nonsense. Financial fair play was brought in to stop clubs becoming overly indebted to their owners. By loaning high quality players Everton are reducing their financial risks. This is entirely consistent with the principles behind the FFP rules. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Daiwaijai, Hong Kong.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">A loan player is not an asset. I am pretty sure FFP requires a club to develop its assets. And building success on temporary players did not exactly stand Bolton in good stead, long term.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So it begins. How dare upstarts Everton get into top five? Stop bashing us - if you don’t like the loan system, speak to the Football Association. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Steve, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I would Steve, but they’re all cowering under the sofa in case someone mentions that Nicolas Anelka business again. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If it gets them Champions League football and increased income to balance the books, it is not bad business. I prefer it to oil money. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Alan, Liverpool. </span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, but why? Both are forms of artificial inflation. Why moralise around one but not the other? </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I seem to recall West Ham United loaned a certain Andrew Carroll and nothing was said. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Michael, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And the reason, Michael? Because Carroll’s presence had minimal impact. I don’t like the loan system; therefore I didn’t like Carroll’s loan to West Ham or any of the loans the club has arranged this season. QED. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I don\'t care. If it\'s right that teams like Manchester City and Chelsea can be bought overnight and transformed into league dominating outfits, I think it\'s only fair that clubs who struggle to attract huge investment can find alternative methods of making the league more competitive. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rchappy88, Burnley.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yes, but it’s on their terms. Don’t you get it? This competition exists only on conditions set by the very clubs you deplore. If Everton start to challenge Chelsea, do you think they’ll get any more players? If Brendan Rodgers wasn’t Jose Mourinho’s mate, and Liverpool seen as mostly harmless, would they have got Victor Moses? Say Moses was a roaring success and was stopping a loan-free Everton team full of local talent coming fourth right now? Is it fair that who you know, or whose back you scratch, gets you a player?</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I wonder if Mourinho would have loaned out Moses and Lukaku if they could have played against him like they can in the Spanish and German leagues? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Arsène, Finsbury Park.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Short answer: no. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">You wrote: \'Barry, a squad player at Manchester City and now 33, but even so he might have commanded £6m as a permanent transfer in the summer.\' Barry is out of contract this summer and was offered to Everton for £1m in January. God only knows where you\'re getting £6m from. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">PJC83, Warrington.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Because January isn’t the summer. Come on mate, we did the months of the year in primary school.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">What you are saying is that you want the Sky Four as it once was to always be on top. Everton cannot compete financially with most clubs but actually have the best manager. This seems to upset you for some reason. You should applaud Everton and what we\'ve done, upsetting the chosen few. Good coaching actually improves players like Barry, Lukaku and Deulofeu. God help us if Everton actually win the Champions League. Who are you going to blame then? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Trobbo66, Plano, Texas.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I’m very sorry that you didn’t understand the column Robbo. You’re probably good at something else. Whittlin’ maybe.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">New rules that need to be implemented: Clubs can only allow players that live within 30 minutes drive of their training ground into the academy. Clubs are not allowed to have contact with players that live outside the catchment area. Clubs cannot tell a player to move to a certain area to comply with rule 1. Only players aged 21 and under can go out on loan. Maximum of three loan signings at each club. Reduce squad size to 23 and abolish the unlimited players under the age of 21 rule. Maximum of 18 players that are not from the club\'s academy allowed in the first team squad. Transfer of teenage players prohibited. Contracted players under the age of 20 cannot move to another club.  Clubs from each country can only sign overseas players that are within 350 miles of their country when they reach 21 years of age. Clubs can only sign players from countries beyond 350 miles when the player reaches 22 years of age. I hope Sepp Blatter reads this. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scott Shelby, Birmingham.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yeah, Scott. He’s a big fan of this column. In fact, he phoned in and requested this one.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/gVWLrloeToA\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Interesting point, but what do you expect clubs like Everton to do? Ignore the possibility of borrowing these players? The system is flawed but Everton must be congratulated for making the best of what is available to them. If they finish above United, even, I will be very impressed. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mick, Bergerac.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Won’t we all, Mick? To answer your question, I expect Everton to carry on doing exactly what they are doing now. I would in their position. I took issue with the system, not the club. That is what has been missed here. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Before even reading the comments I knew there would be several people, presumably Everton supporters, throwing a wobbly, thinking it\'s an attack on their club and playing the victim card. Read the article, it concerns the contradictions of modern football, and it\'s not the first time Martin Samuel has talked about the stupidity of FFP and the consequences for poorer clubs and players. From the elite staying the elite, to clubs hoarding young players or making nearly their whole first XI up from loans. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Plastics Everywhere, United Kingdom.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Ah, my hero. Thanks mate, whoever you are. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Rather than concentrating on the fact Everton are doing very well but happen to have loaned a few players, how about using your journalistic skill to investigate comments made by the Premier League chief executive a few weeks ago concerning Manchester United’s fall from grace and how it could affect the league financially? Could this not be construed to mean that bigger clubs are being favoured on decisions? If this is the way the Premier League think then it could be open to corruption. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">El Bob, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">What, Bob, you mean use my journalistic skills to write about Richard Scudamore’s comments as I did two weeks ago? Try to keep up.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Look at Watford last season, challenging all the way in the Championship because of the loan system, yet this season they are nowhere near the same standard because many of the players went back. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Qwerty123, Brighton.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And so close to promotion via the play-offs, too. Can you imagine? It would have been carnage had they got up and then the rules changed. I was accused of having it in for them, too, I seem to remember. Maybe I just don’t like the theme from Z Cars.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Everton are well within the FA rulebook and they deserve all the plaudits they get. What if Lukaku and the rest had ended up at Arsenal and propelled them to the title? Would it have been right then? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Saj, Manchester.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"What a difference: Watford nearly got promoted last season with a raft of loan players\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"384\" id=\"i-ac5e0e88\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CFDAB2600000578-180_634x384.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">What a difference: Watford nearly got promoted last season with a raft of loan players</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">What a bitter and ignorant article. First of all, Everton are a club that has nine league titles, roughly the same as Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea combined. Only Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool have finished in the top four of English football more times. Yes, football didn\'t begin in 1992 like some would lead you to believe, so Everton making fourth spot wouldn\'t exactly be a fairytale. We are not Wigan Athletic. Lukaku has scored 13 goals this year, so Everton are not relying on him like Liverpool are with Suarez, either. Our team is still built around our defence, where our attack starts. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rdsnuke, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And your history is relevant to this debate how? Oh, I see you resent all these upstart clubs taking what you think is rightfully yours. And you think you should be able to claim it back, no matter how that is achieved, while patronising Wigan, the club that sold you two of your best players and helped groom your manager. Nice. No, football didn’t begin in 1992 mate. So once again, the five clubs whose threatened breakaway culminated in the formation of the Premier League: Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal, Liverpool – and Everton. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Funny how this wasn\'t a problem for the ten years that Everton have utilised the loan system for players like Royston Drenthe. This is lazy journalism from someone who doesn\'t watch Everton enough to know that their most consistent performers have been ones they own. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">DailyTonedMail, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No, that’s a lazy argument from someone who hasn’t followed my writing enough to realise that I’ve been detailing the shortcomings of the loan system for more than 10 years, using examples other than Everton. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If the loan system was not in place, where would the likes of Lukaku and Deulofeu gain the valuable experience of playing in our Premier League? Everton have at least six young players out on loan to lower division teams getting regular game time and both the borrowing clubs and Everton are getting the benefit. If those players improve to the point that when they return to Everton, they can press for first team places. That is a win-win situation for all and needs to be left alone. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bluebyyou, Tonypandy.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So maybe if Everton didn’t have to play Chelsea’s loan players, the Everton players that are out on loan might get a game. Then, maybe Lukaku would have signed for a club that gave him first team football because transfer fees would come down without a stockpiling elite inflating the market. Now there’s a real win-win. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Coleman, loan? Baines, loan? Miralles, loan? McCarthy, loan? Stones, loan? Naismith, loan? Barkley, loan? Howard, loan? No. The team isn\'t just built on three players. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">BlueEFC, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No, but it’s not built on eight, either. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Wenger: eat, sleep, moan, repeat. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">llort, SW4.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I like that. Very funny. A reference to this, for those didn’t get it. (There’s a bit of language near the start, so not for easily upset, although that does seem to apply to a lot of people on here today.)</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3QJE1uP_1gk\" width=\"640\"></iframe><br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">As a Manchester City fan I\'m delighted that the so called Big Four is now becoming the Big Six or Seven. For far too long United, Liverpool and Arsenal dominated the Champions League places and then Chelsea came along and put a spanner in the works. City\'s emergence has caused that much angst amongst the elite that they had to dream up FFP in an attempt to retain the status quo. Fortunately, they haven\'t got the brains to get that right either. So, Toffees, enjoy every minute of this season, hope you only lose one more game (you know which one) but snatch that last Champions League spot. At least two teams every season are going to have to live with no Champions League qualification; it might as well be Arsenal who join United in the Europa League.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> David, Manchester.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">With obvious exceptions, most want Everton in the Champions League – or any new club really. I just think all clubs would have more chance if this loan system ended, so the wealthiest could no longer run squads of 40 with half out on loan, and those other good players were then spread through the league. Permanently.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The loan system is far from ideal but it\'s a damn sight more honest that having some foreign billionaire with little real interest in the game descend from nowhere to transform a middle of the road club into a serious contender. Both Chelsea and Manchester City were nothing remarkable until they were able to buy success off the shelf. When their benefactors get bored they will undoubtedly return from where they came. It is because of clubs like Everton who do well through sheer hard work and shrewd management that we don\'t yet have the situation that exists in Scotland where two rich clubs win everything in sight every year and the rest make up the numbers. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Clive59, Wigan.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">No, Clive, it’s because of Chelsea and City that we’re not Scotland. (And it’s one up there now, not two.) They are the only ones to break the domination of Manchester United and Arsenal. Take them away and we would have become a two club league the moment Blackburn Rovers faded.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Players are currently on loan in the Premier League at Sunderland (five), Fulham (five), West Ham (four), Hull City (three), Stoke City (three), Aston Villa (two), Newcastle United (two). Don\'t hear you complaining about any of them, or is it because a team outside of the big money five are making the system work in their favour? Why not campaign for a squad cap if you want fairness? Say a maximum of 22 players or 27 for clubs in Europe. Oh that\'s right, because it wouldn\'t suit the money five who want to splash their billions to have the best players on their books. Everton never made the rules, we just operate within them and we should be applauded for making the best of a ridiculous system instead of being denigrated.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> BlueAidan, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Did you just copy and paste those statistics, because they are far from complete? There’s the two I mentioned at Arsenal for a start. Why don’t I go through each club individually? Well, let’s say I wrote about John Guidetti and Oussama Assaidi at Stoke. The response would be simple. It doesn’t make any difference, these players are peripheral to the narrative of the Premier League season and Stoke are mid-table, affecting nobody. So to draw attention to the issue the loans have to be an extreme case (like Watford last season, or the current situation at Parma in Italy) or be having an impact on a major issue. Isn’t that obvious? As for your point about capping squad numbers, that already happens. Major clubs get around it with, guess what?</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"No difference: Oussama Assaidi has had minimal impact on the wider Premier League while on loan at Stoke\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"378\" id=\"i-ac5b0e8d\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/10/article-2601297-1CFDB1A400000578-671_634x378.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">No difference: Oussama Assaidi has had minimal impact on the wider Premier League while on loan at Stoke</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">You are right again. I\'d much rather see Chelsea spend £32m on Willian just so Tottenham don\'t get him and £12m on Salah so Liverpool don\'t get him. Also there is no sham in United paying £37m for a Chelsea reserve to try and preserve their top four status because let’s face it everyone wants to see the same finish year after year. Are you the same Martin Samuel who last year was praising Queens Park Rangers for spending £22m on Loic Remy and Christopher Samba on unsustainable wages? That worked out well didn\'t it? <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jez, Liverpool.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Well, every time I watch Chelsea Willian is in the team, so I’d say there was more to that than spite. Same with Mohamed Salah, who is 21 and still a squad man, but is often on the bench. I didn’t actually use the word sham anywhere in the column, and certainly not about Everton, so I don’t think it applies to the Mata transfer any more than it applies to Everton buying McCarthy from Wigan. These were just January transfers and perfectly routine. As for Samba and Remy, I didn’t praise QPR, merely defended their right to have a go at getting out of trouble. Sadly, the club was too diseased for it to work. Even so, they got the transfer fee back for Samba while Remy is on loan at Newcastle, which I keep reading here is a fantastic opportunity for him to get first-team football and for a little club with an average gate of 50,365 owned by one of the five richest men in the country to get a striker they couldn’t otherwise afford. It’s a Christmas miracle, really.</font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It is beginning to worry me that this spotlight is being shone on our loan players at this point of the season. Nobody cared about them last August when they first arrived and everyone was highly complementary towards Martinez for being astute enough to sign them. Now it seems that it\'s not OK because we might actually achieve something. This whole debate is begrudging. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dicey69, Ireland.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Why are you worried? Everton have done nothing wrong. It’s not as if anyone could take fourth place from you if you got it. There is no conspiracy to deny your club anything. In fact, most neutrals – myself included – would be delighted if Everton got top four this season. The praise for Martinez and Kenwright in their astute use of the loan system in August remains. But I don’t like the system and never have. </font></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If Moses scores the winner in a game that clinches the title for Liverpool, should the goal be disallowed because he is on loan? Of course not. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Colefc, Bootle.</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">How about if he misses a sitter and Chelsea win the title, though; or refuses to play because he fears for his future at Stamford Bridge if that happened? What if we did away with a system that created these dilemmas, traded players like the old days and watched fees fall so that – the very cream of the crop aside – Everton could afford to buy who they damn well liked? And wouldn’t lose Rodwell to City because the player would know he might not make the first team and couldn’t be loaned out, so would be better off staying put.

The former Arsenal and England defender believes Chelsea full back Cesar Azpilicueta could be the one to stop Arjen Robben in the Champions League, after the Dutchman dumped Manchester United out of the competition on Wednesday night. Plus, with the London Marathon coming up this weekend, Martin reveals who the fittest player he ever teamed up with was. Here\'s a clue, it\'s between two Arsenal strikers who both played for France. Scroll down to find out who it is and to read all the answers from this week\'s Q&A as they came in.  Conqueror: Arjen Robben celebrates after Bayern Munich\'s Champions League victory over Manchester United  Martin Keown Host commentator Auto-update 13:30 And that\'s your lot We\'ve had some brilliant questions again today. Thanks for joining me for another #TackleKeown. I\'ll be back at the same time, same place next week for more of the same. Until then... 13:26 And today\'s final question: How do you see the Champions League semi-finals going? (From George K via email) A: I don’t think Chelsea will want to face Real Madrid until the final. They have some players who may still not see eye to eye with Jose Mourinho after his spell there and with their quality I feel they would put Chelsea out. He will probably say it would be beautiful to play his former team in the final, but it will be tough, especially as he didn’t achieve European success with them. He will not want somebody else to win that 10th European Cup for Real, he wouldn’t feel like the special one any more. I think Chelsea would love to play Atletico. Jose might feel he has their number after playing them in Spain but Diego Simeone has created some team. I watched them play Real earlier in the season and the whole match was explosive. Challenges were flying in and Simeone creates a frenzy around games. That could make it difficult for Chelsea, but I’m sure they would rather face them than Real or the mighty Bayern. Surprise package: Atletico\'s Koke (left) and David Villa celebrate the decisive goal against Barcelona 13:22 Q: Is this the end of an era for Barcelona? (From Joe in Milton Keynes) A: It feels like it, Joe. We have been saying it for a few years and I think Pep Guardiola saw the end coming. Nobody could understand why he left but he can justify it now. They were a phenomenal side but they haven’t reached those same heights again. The team hasn’t evolved, they don’t seem to have the same energy levels they had in the past and defensively they have been vulnerable for a long time. The transfer embargo will hurt them, because they need a world class central defender. It doesn’t help either that because they set the benchmark their performances have been analysed to death. Teams have figured out how to stop them. Brick wall: Lionel Messi (left) was unable to net against Atletico Madrid Main man: Pep Guardiola is currently taking Europe by storm with Bayern 13:16 Q: Simple question. City or Liverpool? (From Martin in Cheshire) A: This is such a massive game and it’s incredibly hard to predict. Liverpool are flying and Anfield has returned to its former glory. They are terrorising teams there now and if you go and beat them at home, it’s now an upset. Sunday is the kind of game that you’d love to be at live, because the atmosphere will be incredible. City will be incredibly tough opposition but with the significance of the game and the emotion of the Hillsborough anniversary, it’s important for the Liverpool players to keep their heads. But if they get a result, that will give them some extra belief that they can go on and win the title. Key man: David Silva could be crucial for Manchester City against Liverpool Leading star: Luis Suarez is the top scorer in the Premier League 13:14 Q: It\'s the marathon this weekend, who was the fittest player you played with? (From Scott F in the USA) A: I always thought Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka were ahead of anybody else. Henry was rapid but he could do any range and any distance. I always felt that no matter how fast or far he ran he was always holding back. I remember doing a pre-season run for Arsene Wenger when we were told to go at three-quarter pace and see how far we could go. I think Anelka arrived a day later than everybody else so didn’t have the rest of the team to pace himself, but he ended up going about a lap and a half further than everybody else and you realised just how fit he was. They both ran with such high intensity but could go for so long. At Aston Villa under Graham Taylor it was more of a map and compass pre-season. We would just run everywhere and I remember in particular Gordon Cowans playing in midfield – he was a player that could just run all day. Speed freaks: Thierry Henry (right) and Nicolas Anelka (left) were renowned for their physicality 13:10 Q: You played for them both - who do you want to finish fourth Arsenal or Everton? (From TrueBlue) A: It probably won’t surprise anyone, but I always like to see Arsenal do well. I still know a lot of the staff and some of the players there so I will always look out for them. But if anybody else were to get into that top four ahead of them I’d love it to be Everton. It really is a great club and there is something special about Merseyside. The people all passionately love their football and Everton has always prided itself on playing good football. My memories of playing there are all about trying to pass and get the ball moving through the midfield, always looking to emulate that great trio of Alan Ball, Colin Harvey and Howard Kendall. Weight of expectation: Romelu Lukaku (back) could fire Everton into the Champions League 13:07 Q: Who do you think will win the Masters? (From Shane in Texas) A: It’s a shame that Tiger is not there because you always feel lucky to get to watch one of the greats of any sport competing regularly. Without him there I’d like to see Rory McIlroy finally get it together and win, or maybe Ian Poulter. I’ve met Poulter and he is a massive Arsenal fan, but I can’t help think if golf was a team game he’d be player of the year every year! He needs to turn up this weekend and tell himself it’s a Ryder Cup and he could do it. If it’s not a European, I always think Phil Mickelson is so good to watch. I’d love to get out and play a bit more myself but I only ever manage about three or four rounds a year. Occasionally I can hit it like the pros, but inconsistency is a problem for me. I can have eight or nine good holes but never a full round! And no matter what I do, there is always a mystery shot. I can do everything the same but there is always one shot where you wonder, ‘How on earth did it end up over there?’ Eyes on the prize: Rory McIlroy (left) is out to claim the green jacket in Augusta 13:01 Q: Arjen Robben - diver or danger man? (From Suzy in Liverpool) A: A bit of both really! He still threw in two or three major dives last night and the ref just ignored him. It’s a shame he’s got that element to his game because he is a fantastic player, but it was interesting to see the ref largely ignored it. They should punish him more. When he falls over and gets a free kick, it will invariably punish the opposition because he always does it in dangerous areas. I don’t think he’d be so keen to go down in the centre circle! Looking for it? Arjen Robben goes down under a challenge from Patrice Evra 12:56 Q: Mourinho ran down the touchline after Chelsea\'s second goal, what\'s the most bonkers thing you saw Arsene Wenger do after a goal was scored? (Jeff via email) A: I haven’t seen him do too much celebrating to be honest. In our day the aggression and celebration was shown mostly by the players and he was almost apologising with his body language for our behaviour! The last few away games have been tough and he has seemed quite passive, but I think he’s worked bloody hard to keep his cool given what’s happened against Everton and Chelsea! With him, when you win he just has that beaming smile and the lack of success must be tormenting him. I know how hard he works so it would be good to see a cup win put the smile back on his face. Chaos: Jose Mourinho (right) sprinted down the touchline after Demba Ba scored Understated: Arsene Wenger (right) rarely shows his emotions. Martin says that was left to the players 12:49 Q: Fulham v Norwich feels like a Cup Final. What was the most important league game you ever played in? And who do you think will win? (From Isreal, a Fulham fan) A: The smart money goes on a draw, though I think of the two teams Fulham are perhaps more likely to win this. With three managers in a season, the players will feel like they have been in a washing machine. The same will go for Norwich this week after they sacked Chris Hughton. It can destroy hearts and minds when bosses come and go but you do get a feeling of a fresh start with new ideas. Those ideas will have to click quickly because this is a huge game. I think if Norwich get anything from the game, even with the fixtures to come I think they will be safe. In terms of my own career it’s hard to put a finger on a particular game. When I was relegated with Villa we went down against Sheffield Wednesday, but in truth we were down long before that. We still felt we had a chance but the game became desperate and disjointed. At the other end I remember a 1-0 win over Derby in 1998 when Emmanuel Petit scored. That was huge for our title run in. We also beat Bolton 1-0 away that season and Christopher Wreh scored. He’d had two shots from distance before, one went over the bar and the almost out of the ground, so when he took aim again I had to look away. But I heard the roar, knew we’d scored and we managed to hold on to a 1-0 win, even though I was sent off! End of the road: Chris Hughton was axed as Norwich manager Massive: Emmanuel Petit celebrates his crucial Arsenal goal against Derby County Back in the day: Martin, pictured in 1987, remembers his time at Aston Villa 12:42 Q: If Arsenal lose to Wigan, should Wenger go? Even you – as one of his strongest supporters – must be losing the faith. (From Gooner Ron) A: Only Arsene Wenger can answer that, Ron, and I think it’s a question to be asked if it happens. His future is in his own hands and it will be him who decides when to leave. He will not be pushed out of that club. It would be a huge blow if he didn’t win the FA Cup and you can feel the pressure and expectancy building. It almost feels for the fans that the cup has been won already but it never works like that. I know how Wenger works and he’s nothing but positive. He won’t be showing any worries or concerns, if there are any, to the players and he will be well aware of Wigan’s phenomenal second half of season and what they did to Man City. The players will know there’s a chance but you have to make sure you want it more than them. It really is an us or them situation now, whether it’s Man United, Wigan or Bayern Munich. I remember tricky FA Cup semi-finals against Wolves in 1998 and Sheffield United in 2003. Both were scrappy games but we came through them. It’s important Arsenal do the same against Wigan.  In his own hands: Only Arsene Wenger will decide when he leaves the Emirates Stadium Underdogs: Arsenal must be wary of the threat of Wigan at Wembley 12:37 Q: What is wrong with Wayne Rooney? (From Michelle Wells in Oxford) A: Is this the time of year when we start to batter Wayne? I don’t think there’s much wrong with him, Michelle, and he has had a good season. Last night he wasn’t fully fit but still doing a job for his team against one of the best sides in world football. For the first hour they were performing as well as they have done all season. United never really had enough quality possession of the ball to give to Wayne and he was surviving off scraps. He did not look quite as sharp but you never saw him complaining, he just got on with it. Lay off him! Wayne Rooney didn\'t get much service against Bayern Munich 12:30 The first question of the day: Why can’t English teams deal with Robben? You’d have used a reducer on him, surely? (From Adam in Portsmouth) Answer: I don’t think we’re alone there, Adam! He scored the winner in the 2013 Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund, so even German defences couldn’t stop him and Dortmund knocked out Real Madrid last year. He’s just a good player. The team gets enough of the ball team to feed him as regularly as he requires. Inverted wingers are in vogue and when he comes inside, it looks so easy for him on the edge of the box. It will be interesting if they draw Chelsea in the semi-final because he will be against a right-footer in Cesar Azpilicueta. That would make it much easier for him to put in a reducer! When Robben cuts in on his strong foot Azpilicueta will immediately be able to make a challenge, whereas if you’re left-footed you have to run alongside and poke it away. Though sometimes I wonder deep down how much he is annoying Pep Guardiola. Pep likes everything two touch with quick passing, whereas Robben can be a tad selfish to say the least!

Perhaps it\'s the diving, his appetite for deception leaving a sour taste. Perhaps it\'s his self-assured nature, a confidence which borders on arrogance. Perhaps it\'s because he is so successful, winning major titles in four European countries and a Champions League. But it\'s about time we recognised Robben for the terrorising talent that he is – just ask Manchester United. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the fall and falls of Arjen Robben  Main man: Arjen Robben was among the scorers as Bayern Munich knocked Manchester United out of Europe Not much to him: Robben may be slight but he has been a constant thorn in the side of Europe\'s top teams  Robben at a glanceAge: 30Position: ForwardClub career2000–2002     Groningen 28 app/10 goals2002–2004     PSV 70/222004–2007     Chelsea 105/192007–2009     Real Madrid  65/132009–             Bayern Munich 157/87Robben has directly contributed to eight of Bayern’s 21 goals in the Champions League this season with four goals and four assistsInternational careerHolland 73 apps/22 goals The winger was at his unforgiving finest against David Moyes\' men on Wednesday night, seizing upon the slightest slip to turn the tie in favour of his side, Bayern Munich. Thanks to Robben, the Bavarians are through to the last four, on course to become the first team in history to defend the Champions League. His killer contributions against United were separated by just eight minutes. First, with the contest at 1-1, he stole a yard to serve up a teasing delivery which was poked home by team-mate Thomas Muller. Still, though, the visitors needed just one goal to progress. Enter Arjen. Gliding into the penalty area in trademark fashion, United knew what was coming as he fashioned an opening for his lethal left. But despite knowledge of such intent they were powerless to prevent Robben taking aim for the bottom corner and finding it, albeit via a deflection off Nemanja Vidic. Game over. reputation taking a dive: Robben has been much criticised for his antics, including his tendency to go to ground Come on: Robben won a contentious penalty against Arsenal in the Champions League this season Debate: Robben and Wayne Rooney have a disagreement during the second leg at the Allianz Arena  More...

Moyes trips on the learning curve as United crash out of the Champions League Allianz Arena player ratings: Rooney battled hard but it wasn\'t his or United\'s night The Holland winger was, deservedly, man-of-the-match, just as he was 11 months ago on these shores as he scored the goal which sealed Bayern\'s status as the continent\'s No 1, netting the winner in the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. It was his first European crown, some 13 years after making his debut as a 16-year-old for FC Groningen in the Eredivisie. It is a career which has taken in PSV, Chelsea, Real Madrid and, for the past five years, Bayern. Arguably, though, he has never been more dangerous, shown by his return of more than one goal every two games last season. Indeed, his career stats are better than one in three, 152 from 423 matches. Then there are his assists, 14 this season already surpassing last year\'s total of 12. The fall and falls of Robben  Back in the day: Robben won the Community Shield, Premier League and League Cup with Chelsea   Crowning glory: Robben celebrates winning the Champions League with Bayern Munich last season Pulling the trigger: Robben scored the winning goal against Borussia Dortmund to clinch the trophy Robben scores with sublime lob as Bayern defeat Dortmund 3-0  With the benefit of age – he turned 30 this year – has Robben matured into a player capable of marrying his goals and guile like never before? He is already a World Cup runner-up but the likelihood is he won\'t be talked of as one of the stars-in-waiting ahead of this summer\'s contest. Rather, it will be the likes of Wayne Rooney – who he outclassed on Wednesday – who will be the subject of such eulogy. By that point Robben could be heading to Brazil with another Champions League winner\'s medal to add to his already glistening collection of silverware. With the flying Dutchman in this form you might just fancy Holland to go one better than they did in South Africa four years ago.

In a fabulously spontaneous expression of joy, Jurgen Klopp bounded across his technical area and then leapt a good five foot into the air with fists pumping and legs kicking. It was an exuberant celebration, yet at the same time characteristic of a manager who has been a breath of fresh air for not only Borussia Dortmund but wider German and European football. Is Klopp bringing his hip hop to England? Taking off: Klopp sprinted down the touchline after Dortmund scored their winner against Wolfsburg on Saturday and capped it off with a terrific leap Kapow! Klopp soars through the air with arms punching and legs kicking A reason to celebrate: Klopp was marking a winning goal by Marco Reus that saw Dortmund beat Wolfsburg   England calling: Klopp would attract a lot of interest from Premier League clubs if he decided to leave Borussia Dortmund and take up a new challenge  After all, why celebrate with modesty and reserve when you can soar through the air like Michael Jordan or a ninja from Street Fighter? The goal turned out to be Dortmund\'s winner against Wolfsburg and strengthened their hold on second place in the Bundesliga. But after Real Madrid put paid to their hopes of a second consecutive Champions League final three days later, that runners-up spot is about the best Klopp and Dortmund can hope for. The golden age brought about by Klopp has passed almost as quickly as it came. Bayern Munich have restored the natural order. It\'s time for Klopp to take another great leap. Jose Mourinho memorably sprinted down a touchline too. That was back in 2004, when his Porto side stunned Manchester United in the Champions League at Old Trafford.  End of the line: Klopp has won two Bundesliga titles with Dortmund but they now trail Bayern by a long way   Far out in front: Bayern Munich are currently 20 points clear of Dortmund at the top of the Bundesliga, having already secured the title  Jurgen Klopp takes off like Michael Jordan celebrating Reus goal   Jumping for joy: Jose Mourinho lit up the Premier League after making this famous touchline dash  KLOPP\'S RECORD AS A PLAYERMainz (1989-2001) 337 league games, 52 goalsAS A MANAGERMainz (February 2001-June 2008)Games 270 Won 109 Drawn 78 Lost 83 (40.37 per cent win record)Borussia Dortmund (July 2008-)Games 262 Won 152 Drawn 59 Lost 51(58.02 per cent win record) Within another 12 months, he was lighting up the Premier League with Chelsea. Mourinho broke the mould, he was smart, suave, supercilious and ultimately successful. Now it\'s time for cool and colourful Klopp to take the leap and come to England. The Premier League would be a far more interesting place with him. He would break the mould too. The marketplace is bustling if Klopp should choose to have a stroll through. There might be changes afoot at Arsenal or Manchester United. He might fancy a challenge like Aston Villa, West Ham or West Bromwich. What\'s sure is that a fair proportion of the Premier League clubs would want to hire a man who guided an unfancied and under-performing Dortmund side to successive Bundesliga titles and the final of the European Cup. He would be a crowd pleaser as well. Touchline long jump aside, his interviews are rarely boring and his English is already very good.

You would certainly get good value for your season ticket, as Dortmund\'s yellow walls have for the last five years. The 46-year-old is still, comparatively, a managerial novice but you sense he\'s well equipped for the rigours of the Premier League, which we know can be unforgiving. There\'s also the sense that Klopp has done all he can for Dortmund. With their wonderful 80,000-capacity arena and legions of fans, Dortmund had been sleeping giants since the late 1990s and endured their share of financial hardships. Klopp roused and reinvigorated them, restoring pride and smashing the domestic hegemony of rivals Bayern. Supporting and watching BVB was suddenly the height of chic, the hipster\'s choice. They reached the high water mark in beating Real Madrid 4-1 before an ecstatic Westfalenstadion this time last year, with Robert Lewandowski scoring all four - yet they ended the season without a trophy. Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp sent off for incredible rage at...  Last gasp: Arjen Robben scored the winner as Bayern beat Borussia 2-1 in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley   Missing out: Klopp consoles Kevin Grosskreutz after Dortmund\'s best season finished without silverware Familiar sight: Bayern parade the Champions League trophy after their triumph at Wembley  More...

After Mourinho\'s moans, the Premier League are to move Chelsea\'s fixtures to aid their European quest Bale to pen six-year adidas contract extension, joining the elite with £20m jackpot deal At Wembley, Arjen Robben\'s late winner for Bayern, sealing the Treble, left Klopp and co heart-broken. Mario Gotze defected to Bavaria and Lewandowski is about to follow. Realistically, Klopp has taken them as far as he can. Just look at the 20-point gulf to Bayern in the Bundesliga table. Bayern were crowned champions on March 25, an embarrassingly early title conclusion for a league that wins many plaudits for the effective and fan-friendly way in which things are done. But what league is competitive when the best team can poach the best two players of the side in second place? And unfortunately, that could be just the beginning for Borussia as wealthy, carnivorous clubs around Europe strip them of their best players. There is constant speculation that the likes of Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and Sven Bender are about to move, perhaps to the Premier League.  Open to offers: Marco Reus could be the next of Dortmund\'s golden generation to leave   Until next year: The next time Gareth Bale faces Robert Lewandowski, the Pole will be in Bayern colours   Incoming: Dortmund have signed the Hertha Berlin forward Adrian Ramos to replace Lewandowski  This phenomenally strong and entertaining side, who have scaled such great heights together, will be dismantled. All good things must pass. On Wednesday, Borussia announced the signing of Hertha Berlin\'s Colombian striker Adrian Ramos. He\'s undoubtedly prolific but bringing in a 28-year-old to replace Lewandowski doesn\'t inspire confidence in a long-term plan. It\'s time for Klopp to make a clean break of it, enjoy a change of scenery and begin a new project in the Premier League. Like Mourinho, we\'ll quickly grow to love him. Or at least grudgingly admire his success.  More...

It was more like the United of old, and for the first 60 minutes as good a performance as any this season given the calibre of opponent they were up against. This was the all-conquering Bayern Munich. Maybe United do not need the massive overhaul that has been suggested. They looked a good side. It was a brave fight. Patrice Evra’s goal was a thunderbolt struck because he sensed blood at the start of the second half. Bayern responded like champions and it was Evra who allowed Mario Mandzukic to steal in for his header.  I was very impressed with Chris Smalling, there now looks to be a future for him at centre-half; which is a positive from an England point of view. It was a big call by David Moyes to play Smalling in place of Rio Ferdinand but it worked. He looked dominant in the air – and beat Thomas Muller to a commanding header early on – and also coped well in one-on-ones with Franck Ribery when dragged to the wing. He was mobile and used the ball well.  Steppingup: Chris Smalling (right) tussles with Thomas Muller as the centre back covered admirably   Plus point: Phil Jones (centre) has shown promise at right back this season  Phil Jones was another plus point at right back. Moyes will have to play at least one of the youngsters, perhaps both, with Nemanja Vidic and Ferdinand leaving in the summer. This will have been an important experience for both of them and given them confidence. Conversely, Jerome Boateng and Dante did not look comfortable at times in possession. Pep Guardiola likes to play out from the back but when questioned by United’s high pressing they would often go back to Manuel Neuer. The eleven players who should leave Old Trafford in the summer  I was disappointed with Bayern Munich, it was not as difficult for Manchester United as we would have expected. Usually in wide positions they have carousel of players and the full-backs bomb forward. But David Alaba and Philipp Lahm played very central, they came right in to central midfield. It was underlapping rather than overlapping. That made it easier for United to work out who should be picking up who.  Over-tinkering: Although Arjen Robben (right) scored, he will have been frustrated with Bayern\'s system   Game-changer: The introduction of Rafinha (left) gave Bayern added impetus and gave them better shape  It might be because Pep Guardiola wanted Lahm on ball more often, and it also meant Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller could push further forwards. But instead they looked ordinary; it just didn’t work. It’s a system that would drive someone like Arjen Robben mad. He loves short passes with his full-back to cut in and find space in dangerous areas, but there was little chance of that. There was no-one running down the wings to create width. It seemed a case of Guardiola over-tinkering. When Rafinha came on to provide width, Bayern looked a different side.   More...

The difference is that Gerrard has never let his club down either on or off the pitch. As a loyal servant I can think of no better example in football than Gerrard. It’s easy for the likes of Terry and Scholes to stay at their clubs – they were winning medals and trophies. Gerrard remained loyal despite the title eluding Liverpool season after season. He stayed even when Liverpool didn’t make the Champions League. This season he has been reliable from the penalty spot, staying calm to slot home crucial penalties in cauldrons like Old Trafford and Upton Park to help Liverpool to vital victories. His passing from deep has been world class. Hard to believe that after the 2-0 defeat at Arsenal in November a small number of Liverpool fans went on Twitter to suggest Gerrard needed replacing. Never doubt the captain, he’s fantastic. Rodgers: The 96 are motivating our title charge  Clear favourite: Luis Suarez is likely to scoop the Player of the Year awards by virtue of his 29 goals this season   In the running: Eden Hazard is another strong candidate to be named the best player of the season   Front runner: Manchester City\'s Yaya Toure is another contenders for the end-of-season accolades  More... Gerrard: A hot dressing room, dry pitch and the bus had to park a mile away... West Ham did everything they could to upset Liverpool Suarez and Rodgers are going nowhere: Liverpool chief gives sponsors assurances pair will be at Anfield next season Gerrard has scored 10 penalties for Liverpool this season... but how many should have been given? Do the Sturridge! Liverpool star surprises young fans and teaches them THAT dance His leadership has been exemplary. The young players have a star to look up to and learn from, the senior professionals are full of admiration for one of the finest players this country has ever produced. Luis Suarez has been disciplined all season: it’s stretching plausible thinking to believe the Liverpool captain has said nothing to and had no influence on the Uruguayan star. Even if Liverpool don’t win the title, the remarkable improvement from last season is enough for Gerrard to win it. What seals it for me though is what Gerrard has done as England captain. It’s this that sets him apart from the rest this season.  Leading by example: Gerrard celebrates the goal against Poland that made absolutely sure of England\'s progress to the World Cup finals in Brazil     As undisputed skipper for the first time, with no chance of the manager inexplicably giving the armband to John Terry or Rio Ferdinand, Gerrard has flourished. There will be those who claim they don’t care about international football, club comes first. Steven Gerrard is sensible enough to realise you can actually have commitment to both club and country. And we all know that once England get to a World Cup everyone in this country gets interested. Last October, England faced two must-win qualifiers in the space of four days. The mood of the football nation depended on the results of these games.  The dream: Can Gerrard emulate the great Bobby Moore in 1966 and lift the World Cup in Brazil this summer?  Gerrard led his country to a 4-1 victory over Montenegro. And then, late in the game, with England holding a precarious 1-0 lead over Poland, he strode through on goal, showing strength and riding challenges, before poking the ball into the back of the net. At that moment we all breathed a huge sigh of relief. The captain had delivered. He now has an opportunity to be the best captain England have had since Bobby Moore. I hope he takes it. For club and country, Steven Gerrard is my number one this season. As player, captain, and leader – for club and country - nobody comes close.

Less than 48 hours after their fascinating battle in Sunday’s Bahrain Grand Prix, Rosberg was back in his Mercedes cockpit for the first in-season test of the campaign. Rosberg, who has already vowed to beat Hamilton to the chequered flag at the Chinese Grand Prix next Sunday, turned in 121 laps - the equivalent of 413 miles. Rosberg: Fair play to Lewis but I\'ll be back in two weeks to win  Testing, testing: Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg took full advantage of the session in Bahrain on Tuesday Let battle commence: Rosberg (left) and Lewis Hamilton look set for a lengthy and thrilling battle Duel: Hamilton (left) held off the challenge of his team-mate to win the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday  The German also topped the lap charts with a time of 1:35.697, which was four tenths quicker than Nico Hulkenberg in his Force India. ‘I completed 121 laps today in testing here in Bahrain - that’s like London to Paris and nearly all the way back flat out all the time,’ said Rosberg afterwards. ‘I learned a lot, I am starting to smile again, too and I am getting back into full attack mode for Shanghai.  Second best: Force India driver Nico Hulkenberg was four-tenths of a second behind Rosberg in testing  ‘Part of me is happy we apparently put on a great show in Bahrain which is the best way to shut down all the premature criticism that Formula One was getting. ‘I can assure you there is going to be more of that with a different ending obviously.’ Hamilton, who trails his team-mate in the drivers’ standings by 11 points despite back-to-back wins in Malaysia and Bahrain will take over testing duties from Rosberg on Wednesday.

West Ham defender Winston Reid, Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry and Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku were the men he wanted at White Hart Lane next season. Sherwood’s recommendations had been taken so seriously during a transfer meeting the previous month that director of football Franco Baldini went to watch Fulham play Everton on March 30, instead of travelling to Anfield to watch Tottenham. Given the 4-0 scoreline at Liverpool, it was a wise decision.

Lukaku and Barry both played the full 90 minutes for Everton in their 3-1 victory and they were wanted men. Sherwood was desperate to get them to Spurs. At the time he was in with a chance of keeping the job, despite the interest from Louis van Gaal, Frank de Boer, Carlo Ancelotti and Mauricio Pochettino. Of the names under consideration at White Hart Lane, former Tottenham striker Jurgen Klinsmann is the only candidate who has not been agitating for the job behind the scenes. Big tick there from the boardroom. More on them in a moment. Sherwood knows he has made mistakes since he replaced Andre Villas-Boas as Tottenham’s manager and it probably wasn’t a good idea to ask for the ear of the chairman after another leathering, this time at Anfield. Goodness knows Levy has had a gutful of that this season and anybody who knows him will tell you that no-one gets away with humiliating Tottenham’s chairman in public. This season alone he has been on the end of some hidings: 6-0 and 5-1 against Manchester City, 5-0 and and 4-0 against Liverpool, 4-0 at Chelsea, 3-0 at home to West Ham and three defeats against Arsenal. In Levy’s world, someone will always pay the price for that. Sherwood has certainly provided some entertainment in his 23 games in charge of Spurs, but Levy believes he lacks maturity and stature for such a prestigious position.  Tim\'s targets: Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry (below left) and Winston Reid (below right) were wanted by Sherwood when he thought he still had a future as Tottenham manager     It probably wasn’t wise, even in jest, for Sherwood to say that he would be returning to the technical area for the Sunderland game and ‘might knock a few people out’. He knows that. He is highly-emotional, passionate about his work and his team. There is something to be said for that, even if it is a bit much at times. Sherwood spoke of the ‘shackles coming off’ after the team ran out 5-1 winners against Sunderland on Monday, shining a torch on his pre-match team talk with Tottenham’s players. They have been made aware that their manager is leaving at the end of the season and will be replaced someone with vast experience in the game.  Waiting game: Louis van Gaal (right) has kept Spurs hanging on as he watches the situation at Manchester United Big tick: Jurgen Klinsmann (left) is favoured by the Spurs board, while Frank De Boer also wants the job Under pressure: Carlo Ancelotti (left) remains an option for Tottenham if he is fired by Real Madrid Not the answer: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino isn\'t ready to manage Tottenham  More... Everton fairytale has us hooked, shame it\'s built on £50m loan sham of Lukaku, Barry and Deulofeu (so Wenger\'s right to moan) I won\'t be No 2 at Spurs, says Sherwood as Tottenham line up Holland boss Van Gaal Van Gaal reveals he\'s \'totally sick\' of being a national team coach as Holland boss opens door for Spurs move in the summer The mad world of King Louis van Gaal: Tottenham\'s next boss in waiting? Lukaku transfer hinders on World Cup as Chelsea hope strong display from Belgium star will increase asking price That is Levy’s wish, something he has already articulated to his board as he begins to plan for next season. Presumably this means Southampton manager Pochettino, who has lost twice against Tottenham in the league this season, is not ready for the 14th biggest job in European football, according to the 2014 Deloitte Money League. At 42, a man who refuses to speak English despite a near perfect command of the language, is not the answer for Tottenham at this moment in time. Klinsmann, who is preparing for the World Cup with the USA, had been offered the position until the end of the season when Villas-Boas was fired. Levy had tried to tempt him with the bait that he could keep a closer eye on the Americans playing in Europe if he could help Spurs out in the short term. Klinsmann said no. Sherwood\'s journey from happy-go-lucky rookie to troubled manager   Rebuilding job: Daniel Levy (front) will have to appoint yet another manager  After Real Madrid’s stunning 4-3 defeat at home by Barcelona on March 23, Ancelotti was under so much pressure at the Bernabeu he believed he could be fired at the end of the season. His team are now third in La Liga, three points off Atletico, although they are in Friday’s draw for the Champions League semi-final after beating Borussia Dortmund. Ancelotti has not been ruled out. The Italian remains an option if he is fired. Then there is Van Gaal, the man who has kept Tottenham waiting after hanging out for the possibility that Manchester United could replace David Moyes. The relative upturn in recent results, with the exception of the 3-0 defeat at home by Manchester City, has closed the door on Van Gaal’s hopes of heading to Old Trafford. Moyes is staying for the time being. Sherwood will not remain and he will walk away from Spurs after their final game of the season at home to Aston Villa on May 11. Beyond that, Levy will have to start rebuilding this club. Again.   More...

Lloyd denies it - ‘not true, but it wouldn’t have been a bad tactic’ - though the myth might have occurred to Tissara Perera as he stood at long-off on Sunday and watched Yuvraj Singh hit a Nuwan Kulasekara full-toss straight in his direction. It’s not usually sensible to grant Yuvraj a life. But this was his 21st ball – and he had managed only 11. India were going nowhere, and slowly.

His dad Yograj has already issued a ‘don’t blame my boy’ plea. We await the burning effigies. Meltdowns in cricket are supposed to be the preserve of bowlers – especially left-arm spinners, though Leicestershire seamer Scott Boswell’s 14-ball over in the final of the 2001 C&G Trophy at Lord’s remains perhaps the most famous example. Yet Yuvraj’s tortured half-hour in Dhaka must take its place among cricket’s cruellest vignettes. And it’s unclear whether the post-match words of his captain MS Dhoni will have helped. ‘Yuvi tried his best,’ said Dhoni, falling awkwardly between an arm round the shoulder and a patronising pat on the head. It’s the kind of thing my sports teachers used to say to me. The sense of cruelty on Sunday stemmed from a few factors. Seven years ago, during the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa, Yuvraj hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over at Durban. That, not 21 boundary-less balls, was supposed to be his T20 epitaph. And this was the final of a tournament in which India had been the best – and, until now, only unbeaten – team. Victory here, and they would hold all three global ICC trophies. A miserable few months would be glossed over! Then there was the impending IPL, a competition which routinely turns the other cheek to its latest corruption scandal and proclaims itself the zenith of all things T20. What better way to whet appetites than for Yuvraj, one of the IPL’s poster boys, to go berserk? All the while, at the other end, was Virat Kohli, a smouldering ball of fury at the best of times and comfortably the best batsman in the competition. Yet during India’s dreadful final four overs, he managed to face only eight balls. The script was being torn up in front of his face – by a team-mate. When Yuvraj approached Kohli during the presentation ceremony and gave him a hug – half-consoling, half-apologetic – Kohli barely glanced up from his smartphone.  Missing out: A struggling Yuvraj watches the ball go by  More...

And it was a reminder that a poor innings can be just as destructive to a team’s chances in Twenty20 as a poor spell. Batting can be as lonely as bowling. The former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe suggested on Twitter that ‘it was like watching Bradman at one end and Chris Martin at the other. T20 at its worst. Bring in the batting sub rule.’ It’s a nicely quirky idea, and few are better at those than Crowe. But Yuvraj’s struggles were grimly compelling. Boswell had to complete that over 13 years ago – so why should Yuvraj have been allowed to escape Sri Lanka’s bowlers? One of them couldn’t hit the cut strip, and the other couldn’t get it off the square. But, really, what’s the difference? Twenty20 is a batsman’s game, so let’s occasionally hear it for the bowlers. Besides, Sri Lanka’s seamers were not easy to hit. In the 11 legal deliveries that followed Yuvraj’s departure, India scored just seven off the bat. Dhoni, regarded as one of history’s finest finishers, made four runs off seven balls. Had no one watched Ravi Bopara’s handling of Lasith Malinga in Chittagong? So, yes, Yuvraj had a shocker. But should he have been put in that position in the first place? He had, after all, produced only one innings of note all tournament – 60 off 43 balls against a poor Australian side in a game India didn’t need to win. His three other innings ahead of the final had produced 29 runs from 38 balls. He was manifestly out of touch, as he has been in international cricket for some time. Dhoni did his best to defend Yuvraj afterwards, protesting that only Suresh Raina among India’s batsmen was capable of timing the ball from the very start. But this didn’t deal with the obvious fact that Yuvraj was badly out of nick, nor did it tally with Dhoni’s promotion of himself above Raina. India’s experience of the semi-final win over South Africa, when Raina made 21 off 10 balls to turn the chase into a stroll, seemed to have been completely forgotten.  Contrast: As Yuvraj struggled, Virat Kohli (right) was in superb nick but did not face enough deliveries  THE TOP SPIN ON TWITTER For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin Logic suggested a batting order of Raina-Dhoni-Yuvraj. In the event, Yuvraj-Dhoni-Raina cost India the title. And yet, as Boris Becker once said after losing at Wimbledon, ‘Nobody died.’ In fact, a few people – especially in Colombo – may even have come alive. Besides, Twenty20’s critics often complain of its tedious predictability, of one six after another robbing it of tension. Yuvraj’s innings, in the most-watched Twenty20 international for years, bucked the trend spectacularly. He may not appreciate the thought right now, but Yuvraj may just have done Twenty20 a favour.

In private, the message is being conveyed that other boards are dealing with an organisation and not an individual. In other words, the ground is being prepared: if the embarrassment of appointing as ICC chairman a man who has redefined ‘conflicts of interest’, who seemed remarkably unclear about the role his son-in-law played at Chennai Super Kings, and who has presided over the most bullying organisation in cricket since the days of the old Anglo-Australian veto – if the embarrassment grows too strong, the likes of the ECB and Cricket Australia can always claim they were negotiating with the BCCI and not Srini himself. Brilliant, eh? In the meantime, let’s leave you with the words of Paul Marsh, boss of FICA: ‘The prospect of Mr Srinivasan taking the highest posting in world cricket, while these matters are unresolved, is an impossible one.’ But is anyone listening? Sneaking up on the rails Last week this column argued that Ashley Giles – everyone’s favourite new punchbag – deserved not to be written off on the basis of one Twenty20 shocker (just as he didn’t deserve a knighthood for England’s now forgotten victory over Sri Lanka). But the rumour mill is cranking into gear. What price a return to the coaching job for Peter Moores?  Moores the merrier: Peter Moores, here in charge of Lancashire, is in the frame for a return as England coach  His supporters will tell you that the England dressing-room no longer contains Kevin Pietersen and Michael Vaughan, two of Moores’s greatest critics during his two years in charge. But it does contain three players – Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Jimmy Anderson – who all rated Moores highly, and felt that extra-curricular dramas (read: KP) distracted him from the main job. One intriguing figure is Paul Collingwood, who was no fan of Moores’s intense coaching methods during his time as a player, but has recently found himself back in the inner sanctum as a part-time assistant and fielding coach. More crucial, perhaps, is Andy Flower – who replaced Moores in 2009 but swears by his methods after working as his No 2. Watch this space. Pure sixism Spare a thought for England’s women, who were trying to win a global tournament without the injured duo of strike bowler Katherine Brunt and off-spinner Laura Marsh. But that didn’t explain their main deficiency out in Bangladesh: an inability to clear the rope. Not once in six games did an England player hit a six.  No six appeal: England batsmen such as Charlotte Edwards (right) failed to clear the ropes at the World T20  If you suspect this might be a failure of the women’s game in general, think again. There were 57 sixes in the women’s World Twenty20, and 18 were hit by the eventual champions Australia. In fact, only two of the 10 teams failed to clear the rope – England and Ireland. That England reached the final at all says plenty for their skill. But there is a gaping hole in the jigsaw. Hold your horses! Despair behind the scenes that the Pietersen message is trumping the ECB’s may have grown last week when Graeme Smith, KP’s captain at Surrey, spoke out in defence of his county colleague. And while the pro-KP camp leapt on Smith’s suggestion of poor management by the ECB as evidence that their man was hard done by, it may have been just as relevant to note one of Smith’s caveats. For he was honest enough to admit: ‘I’m uninformed at the moment, and speaking from an outsider’s perspective.’ Quite.  \'Outsider\'s perspective\': Graeme Smith spoke out in defence of his Surrey team-mate Kevin Pietersen    More...

His dad Yograj has already issued a ‘don’t blame my boy’ plea. We await the burning effigies.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Meltdowns in cricket are supposed to be the preserve of bowlers – especially left-arm spinners, though Leicestershire seamer Scott Boswell’s 14-ball over in the final of the 2001 C&amp;G Trophy at Lord’s remains perhaps the most famous example.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Yet Yuvraj’s tortured half-hour in Dhaka must take its place among cricket’s cruellest vignettes. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And it’s unclear whether the post-match words of his captain MS Dhoni will have helped. ‘Yuvi tried his best,’ said Dhoni, falling awkwardly between an arm round the shoulder and a patronising pat on the head. It’s the kind of thing my sports teachers used to say to me.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The sense of cruelty on Sunday stemmed from a few factors. Seven years ago, during the inaugural World Twenty20 in South Africa, Yuvraj hit Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over at Durban. That, not 21 boundary-less balls, was supposed to be his T20 epitaph.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">And this was the final of a tournament in which India had been the best – and, until now, only unbeaten – team. Victory here, and they would hold all three global ICC trophies. A miserable few months would be glossed over!</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Then there was the impending IPL, a competition which routinely turns the other cheek to its latest corruption scandal and proclaims itself the zenith of all things T20. What better way to whet appetites than for Yuvraj, one of the IPL’s poster boys, to go berserk?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">All the while, at the other end, was Virat Kohli, a smouldering ball of fury at the best of times and comfortably the best batsman in the competition. Yet during India’s dreadful final four overs, he managed to face only eight balls.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The script was being torn up in front of his face – by a team-mate. When Yuvraj approached Kohli during the presentation ceremony and gave him a hug – half-consoling, half-apologetic – Kohli barely glanced up from his smartphone. <br/></font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Missing out: A struggling Yuvraj watches the ball go by\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"426\" id=\"i-abc10e7b\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/07/article-2598932-1CE26A2300000578-187_634x426.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Missing out: A struggling Yuvraj watches the ball go by</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"moduleHalf\"><div class=\"relatedItemsTopBorder\"> </div> <div class=\"relatedItems\"> <h4>More...</h4> <ul> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2598924/Kevin-Pietersen-set-Indian-Premier-League-Alastair-Cook-scores-39-Essex.html\"> Pietersen jets off to India for IPL as Cook returns to the crease after Ashes nightmare</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2598739/Joe-Root-signs-two-year-contract-extension-Yorkshire.html\"> Root signs two-year extension to stay with Yorkshire through to 2016</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2598348/James-Anderson-takes-five-Lancashire-England-hopefuls-struggle-opening-day-County-Championship.html\"> Anderson takes five but England hopefuls struggle on opening day of County Championship</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2598206/Sri-Lanka-win-major-trophy-1996-defeat-India-World-T20.html\"> Sri Lanka legends Sangakkara and Jayawardene bow out in style with World Twenty20 triumph</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2598079/England-Women-slump-six-wicket-defeat-World-T20-final-against-superb-Aussies.html\"> England Women slump to six wicket defeat in World T20 final against superb Aussies</a></li> <li><a href=\"/sport/cricket/article-2597800/England-captain-Charlotte-Edwards-dreams-Aussie-double-ahead-Womens-World-T20-final.html\"> England captain Edwards dreams of Aussie double ahead of Women\'s World T20 final</a></li> </ul> </div>   </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It was dramatic, all right. And it was a reminder that a poor innings can be just as destructive to a team’s chances in Twenty20 as a poor spell. Batting can be as lonely as bowling.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The former New Zealand captain Martin Crowe suggested on Twitter that ‘it was like watching Bradman at one end and Chris Martin at the other. T20 at its worst. Bring in the batting sub rule.’ </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It’s a nicely quirky idea, and few are better at those than Crowe. But Yuvraj’s struggles were grimly compelling. Boswell had to complete that over 13 years ago – so why should Yuvraj have been allowed to escape Sri Lanka’s bowlers? </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">One of them couldn’t hit the cut strip, and the other couldn’t get it off the square. But, really, what’s the difference? Twenty20 is a batsman’s game, so let’s occasionally hear it for the bowlers.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Besides, Sri Lanka’s seamers were not easy to hit. In the 11 legal deliveries that followed Yuvraj’s departure, India scored just seven off the bat. Dhoni, regarded as one of history’s finest finishers, made four runs off seven balls. Had no one watched Ravi Bopara’s handling of Lasith Malinga in Chittagong?</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">So, yes, Yuvraj had a shocker. But should he have been put in that position in the first place? He had, after all, produced only one innings of note all tournament – 60 off 43 balls against a poor Australian side in a game India didn’t need to win. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">His three other innings ahead of the final had produced 29 runs from 38 balls. He was manifestly out of touch, as he has been in international cricket for some time.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Dhoni did his best to defend Yuvraj afterwards, protesting that only Suresh Raina among India’s batsmen was capable of timing the ball from the very start. </font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">But this didn’t deal with the obvious fact that Yuvraj was badly out of nick, nor did it tally with Dhoni’s promotion of himself above Raina. India’s experience of the semi-final win over South Africa, when Raina made 21 off 10 balls to turn the chase into a stroll, seemed to have been completely forgotten.</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Contrast: As Yuvraj struggled, Virat Kohli (right) was in superb nick but did not face enough deliveries\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"652\" id=\"i-9eed0e4c\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/07/article-2598932-1CE248B600000578-62_634x652.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Contrast: As Yuvraj struggled, Virat Kohli (right) was in superb nick but did not face enough deliveries</p> </div>\n<p></p>\n<div class=\"floatRHS art-ins sport\"><h3 class=\"wocc\"><b>THE TOP SPIN ON TWITTER</b><br/></h3><div class=\"ins cleared xolcc bdrcc\"><p> <font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to </font><a href=\"https://twitter.com/the_topspin\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"font-weight:bold;\" target=\"_blank\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">twitter.com/the_topspin</font> </a><br/></p></div></div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Logic suggested a batting order of Raina-Dhoni-Yuvraj.

Reds skipper Steven Gerrard scored his ninth and 10th penalties of the season, while Yaya Toure put in a spot-kick inspired performance of his own for Manchester City. Will the performance of Manchester United\'s January signing Juan Mata earn a place in the top 10 after a brace against Newcastle United on Saturday?  Unstoppable? Luis Suarez (left) tops the Power Rankings after an excellent performance against West Ham  Here, with football data analysts Kickdex, we assess which players have played the biggest role for their team over the past six games - either by helping them score or by stopping their opponents from scoring.  Everything that happens on the pitch is taken into account, from the easiest pass to the unluckiest deflection.  We\'ll reveal the top 10 players each Monday after a weekend of Premier League fixtures, as well as a top five breakdown of the four main positions.  Tricky: Suarez didn\'t score but earned his side a first half penalty after forcing James Tomkins into a handball At the double: Juan Mata score twice and grabbed an assist for Manchester Untied against Newcastle  More... Liverpool players furious as Carroll foul is shown on big screen moments after controversial goal is awarded... did West Ham break rules by replaying incident? MAD DOG ON MONDAY: Torres used to be like an F1 car but he\'s slowed down so it\'s time to let him go... and why I chose Woking over Bayern Munich Rodgers would love it if he could beat them to it... but unlike Keegan, the Liverpool boss is staying cool on the road to greatness JAMIE REDKNAPP: Toure, Lambert and Gerrard are the penalty perfectionists... but there\'s no point in practising spot-kicks before the World Cup Gerrard praises Liverpool resolve after Carroll foul leads to Hammers equaliser... but still isn\'t convinced they can win the title  10. Juan Mata (Manchester United) +32 Two goals and an assist during United\'s 4-0 win against Newcastle moves the Spaniard into the top 10. 9. Tim Howard (Everton) +2 The Everton goalkeeper grabbed another clean sheet as his side defeated Arsenal in the pivotal Premier League clash a Goodison Park. Howard made several excellent saves including keeping out a Lukas Podolski volley. 8. Jay Rodriguez (Southampton) -2 Sadly, the English striker\'s season looks to be over after a knee injury forced Rodriguez off at half-time. The knock comes at a terrible time for the 24-year-old who looks likely to miss out on the 2014 World Cup. 7. Nemanja Matic (Chelsea) +1 Chelsea\'s January signing put in another lung-busting performance for the west London side and even managed an assist - setting up Mohamed Salah for the first goal against Stoke.  Blow: Jay Rodriguez suffered a nasty looking knee injury which has cast doubt over a World Cup place    Spider: Chelsea\'s Nemanja Matic moved from eighth to seventh in the Power Rankings list  6. David Silva (Manchester City) +1 The Spanish maestro inspired City to another Premier League win and was key to his side\'s first half comeback after a Rickie Lambert penalty levelled the scoring.  Maestro: Manchester City midfielder David Silva put in another superb performance on Saturday  5. Martin Skrtel (Liverpool) +9 The Liverpool defender faced a difficult task on Sunday as he looked to battle West Ham striker Andy Carroll in the air at every opportunity. Skrtel passed the test and was vital to Liverpool\'s win.  Power: Youssouf Mulumbu enters the Power Ranking top 10 after West Brom\'s win against Norwich  4. Youssouf Mulumbu (West Brom) +9 The Congolese star put in a huge shift for the Baggies as Morgan Amalfitano grabbed the only goal to take all three points away from Carrow Road.  Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard scored two penalties to hand Liverpool victory against West Ham    3. Steven Gerrard (Liverpool) +1 The Liverpool skipper has been in brilliant form this season and showed his class once again to score two penalties which inspired Liverpool to a vital win against West Ham. Gerrard also played a stunning 40-yard pass to Luis Suarez which lead to Liverpool\'s first spot-kick.  Form: Yaya Toure scored another penalty for Manchester City during their 4-1 win against Southampton  2. Yaya Toure (Manchester City) +2 Toure keeps hold of second spot after scoring his 18th Premier League goal of the season on Saturday as the Ivorian lead City to an impressive 4-1 win against Southampton. 1. Luis Suarez (Liverpool) The Uruguayan marksman retains his place at the top of this week\'s Power Ranking despite not actually scoring against West Ham on Sunday afternoon. Suarez was a constant threat to the Hammers\' defence and earned the first penalty of the game by being too quick for James Tomkins.  Leading the way: Suarez keeps his spot at the top of the Power Rankings after another excellent week     Engine room: Find out which players are the masters all over the pitch in our position-by-position breakdown    More...

He wanted a facilitator. It is football’s modern way. Rules are out, game management is in; regulation is out, assistance is in; black and white is out, the Wild West is in. The clubs do not wish to be told what to do, on or off the field; they just want help in doing as they please. So a foul is not a foul, a contract is not a contract and paperwork is for the little people in the leagues below — or merely a basis for negotiation. Leave aside Pochettino’s complaint about Manchester City’s second goal being offside. Yes it was, by some distance. A huge mistake by the linesman. Very unfortunate, but they happen and there really is no way around it unless we rewind the film every time a goal is scored to see if some minor infringement occurred in the build-up. The game would be delayed, and goals could be wiped off but not added on — so we would cure one form of injustice, but create another.  Contentious: Manchester City\'s second goal, scored by Samir Nasri, was clearly offside   Flick: Edin Dzeko played Yaya Toure\'s pass (above) into the path of Silva, who was yards offside   Wild thing: Mauricio Pochettino was livid that the goal was given after seeing his team push City all the way Pochettino: It seemed like the type of decision you get at school  Time to come clean over KP Alastair Cook hopes he will be able to explain precisely why Kevin Pietersen was sacked at some date in the future. He implies there is much more that is not known, that cannot be known, for now. So was Pietersen an MI5 spy? Was he engaged in counter-espionage? Are there agents in the field that could be placed at risk by Cook’s disclosures, their cover blown? For if Pietersen was simply a gifted but high-maintenance cricketer, who fell out with a lot of team-mates, stopped scoring prolifically and was ultimately considered too much trouble, then this mutual confidentiality agreement is ludicrous and  Cook should stop the secret-squirrel act and front up. No, it is Pochettino’s complaint about City’s first goal that tells us about the nature of modern football. That third-minute penalty. Edin Dzeko goes past Southampton defender Jose Fonte at pace. He beats him so comprehensively that he actually runs outside Fonte, who now has his back to the player. So Fonte sticks out a leg behind him, as if drawing it back to shoot, and brings down Dzeko. This is the judgment call that Pochettino finds so objectionable. ‘I don’t think you can give a penalty like that after just two minutes,’ he says. It’s an interesting take on the laws of the game. Anything goes, as long as it happens early enough. Kick who you like, trip who you like, just make sure you get it done quick. Football for 80 minutes, Rollerball the first 10. Inexplicable, Pochettino called the penalty. And there is a lot that needs explaining these days.Take the saga at Sunderland, who fielded an ineligible player, Ji Dong-won, for five matches, but lost no points and somehow kept the matter secret. Just as Pochettino wanted Chris Foy to manage his game so that early infringements had no consequence, so the Premier League did not even deduct the single point Sunderland had gained (against Southampton) from Ji Dong-won’s appearances. Just as they ignored the impact Carlos Tevez had on West Ham’s survival in 2006-07.  Leg up: Jose Fonte fouls Dzeko for the penalty... which Pochettino said happened too early in the game   No question: Referee Chris Foy points to the spot, with Yaya Toure duly converting the subsequent penalty   No penalty: Sunderland have avoided a points deduction for fielding Ji Dong-won, an ineligible player, for four Premier League matches  More... Pochettino so angry at offside Nasri goal that \'killed\' the game he gives first interview in English since arriving last January Man City 4-1 Southampton: Pellegrini\'s men close gap on Liverpool with comfortable win Baggies furious after Sunderland escape points deduction for fielding illegal player Sunderland say case is closed after playing Ji when he was ineligible... but rivals say Black Cats are lucky to escape with a fine Crooks charter: Football fears the worst after fraudster Cellino is given go-ahead for £35m takeover at Leeds 39 of the 40 Grand National jockeys in revolt over race\'s manic start The Tevez case really is a landmark because it sums up the way football administration has changed. In a key revelation from the time, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore explained what would have happened had West Ham not lied about the third party ownership portion of Tevez’s contract and instead presented it to the league. Nothing. Tevez would still have been registered a West Ham player before the transfer deadline, would still have been free to make his debut that weekend, but then on Monday, the league’s lawyers and the club’s representatives would have met and redrafted the contract in a form that was acceptable. They would have facilitated West Ham’s aim. This is not Scudamore’s fault. He is employed by the 20 Premier League chairmen and provides the service they desire. If they wanted a tough administrator, he could be that, too. They don’t. They want someone to look kindly on their indiscretions and sort out any complications, so that if Sunderland end up with a player in the team who has not received international clearance, it is viewed benignly as a misunderstanding, not an offence. The Premier League were even sending media guidance letters around this weekend, explaining Sunderland’s position in the mildest terms, that Ji Dong-won was correctly registered with them, and with FIFA, but then went on loan to Augsburg in Germany, and it was only on his return that he dropped off the international list.  Carlito\'s way: Carlos Tevez remains a hero at West Ham after scoring this goal on the final day of the 2006-07 season at Old Trafford to preserve the club\'s top flight status   Hammer of the year: Tevez was a huge hit in east London, but his tenure at Upton Park saw the club fined £5.5million after being found guilty of acting improperly and withholding vital documentation  More from Martin Samuel - Sport...   MARTIN SAMUEL: The rules are out and this Wild West show can run and run in the Premier League... just ask Pochettino about the state of football 06/04/14   MARTIN SAMUEL: How can you NOT blame Giles for English cricket\'s latest shambles? 01/04/14   MARTIN SAMUEL: Ferguson had to pick a successor or tell United to get stuffed.

So they filled it in, but forgot to press send. Try that one with the Inland Revenue if your tax returns don’t arrive next January. Sunderland are not in the same realm as West Ham in 2007. There was genuine deception over Tevez, whereas what happened with Ji Dong-won seems more of a cock-up, but the response is the same. Just as the independent adjudicators did not want to take points from West Ham — or Sheffield United, Watford, Manchester United and Everton, who all entered into gentleman’s agreements amounting to third-party interference that season — so Sunderland’s punishment was kept under wraps, and was met by writing an insubstantial cheque. An easy solution would be simple, and finite. Every match that Tevez played, every match that Ji Dong-won played, three points awarded to the opposition. Sunderland were so poor at the start of the season that they would only be a point worse off — and opponents Southampton’s two additional points would not alter their League position at all. Yet, the League did not know this at the time. They were gambling that this would not come back to haunt them, as it did with Tevez. One club at the bottom is now considering its legal position, but the interesting aspect is none of the others are — including Southampton. As long as it does not directly affect them, they are happy for the Wild West show to continue just as it is.   Indeed, the last time Scudamore tried to outlaw loan signings, the chairmen not only voted against it but added some of the loan-market rules to permanent transfers; this is why Stephen Ireland couldn’t play for Stoke City against Aston Villa last month.  Inexplicable: Pochettino mocked up as the man with no name from Sergio Leone\'s Dollars trilogy  The next stage, and it is already here, is for the actual games to be refereed along these lines. Managed, not regulated, handled, not administered. Inexplicable, Pochettino called it. For someone who claims to speak little English, he got that much right.  Craven council is destroying Glasgow’s reputation crashes There is a reason April Fools’ Day hoaxes in newspapers rarely work these days. Our modern reality is more outlandish than anything a prankster can dream up. For instance: as part of the opening ceremony for the Commonwealth Games this summer, five of Glasgow’s Red Road tower blocks will be blown up, and the demolition beamed around the world. The stunt will last 15 seconds and will obliterate homes that once housed close to 5,000 people. As the Red Road flats were inhabited from 1966, that is a lot of memories, a lot of love and laughter that will go up in smoke for the temporary amusement of a global television audience.  Iconic: The Red Road flats will be demolished as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony   Up in smoke: Five of the six tower blocks will be demolished - a ritual which will take just 15 seconds  Eileen Gallagher, chair of the Glasgow 2014 Ceremonies, Culture and Queen’s Baton Relay Committee, said: ‘By sharing the final moments of the Red Road flats with the world, Glasgow is proving it is a city that is proud of its history but doesn’t stand still, a city that is constantly regenerating, renewing and re-inventing itself.’ No it isn’t. It is proving that the organisers of its Games are crass, unfeeling and will do anything for publicity, and that its council thinks nothing of housing its citizens in asbestos-riddled  high-rise hutches, which it then randomly detonates as if the whole exercise was an episode of Game For A Laugh. The Red Road flats may have ended up horrible places to live, but the former residents deserve to see them demolished with dignity and respect for their existence, not in the manner of some prank by Jeremy Beadle. Asylum seekers now occupy the sixth block which will remain standing. What message does the collapse of all around them send about the attitude of their adopted country? That it houses its newest citizens in homes that are little better than rubble. The joke is on them — and live on television, too.  Reduced to rubble: The Red Road flats will no longer be a feature of Glasgow\'s skyline   Final inspection: workers inspect the flats in north Glasgow before their live demolition  The world will be watching, according to the organisers, and this being the Commonwealth Games that audience will include people affected by war or extreme forces of nature, such as tropical storms and hurricanes; people who might look at the Red Road flats, compare their own humble living conditions, and wonder why this wealthy European nation is blowing up what would appear perfectly decent forms of shelter. A lot of the food we consume in the west is unhealthy, too. Yet we wouldn’t dump it on a fire in front of people who are starving, because that would be grossly insensitive. This stunt says nothing about the new Glasgow, but all too much about the craven nature of the city’s council overseers.  And while we\'re at it The start of the Grand National was the usual fiasco and now 39 of its 40 riders face action for approaching the start before being  officially called forward. Only Brendan Powell, whose stubborn mount Battle Group refused to race, has escaped. The jockeys are in open revolt over the prospect of sanction and the mess now moves to the British Horseracing Authority’s headquarters in London. There remains an unhealthy attitude that racing is a gentlemen’s sport, and riders are no better than staff. They need to be put in their place.  Questioned: Jockeys were asked why they had approached the tape before the starter invited them   On your marks: The starter attempts to get the Grand National underway  Yet what was the problem? It was 4.15pm. Time to go. If your horse won’t move or is facing the wrong way when the race is due to begin, tough. They’re off. The jockeys were ready at the appropriate time; it was the starter who needed to get his act together.  If Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman don’t get the Strictly Come Dancing gig, will there be an outcry about sexism on Charlotte Moore’s watch at BBC1? It wasn’t so long ago that Moore, the channel controller, was advocating that women should have a dedicated role on Match of the Day — presumably in a pundit’s seat, as the presenter’s chair is already occupied by Gary Lineker.  Double act: Bruce Forsyth is leaving Tess Daly\'s side after 11 years of Strictly Come Dancing   Options: Claudia Winkleman has been touted as Forsyth\'s replacement, as has the impish Graham Norton  Now it gets interesting. Daly and Winkleman have been fronting Strictly’s Sunday results show with charisma and professional ease for several years now. They would be the obvious choices to take over on Saturday, too, now that Sir Bruce Forsyth has stood down. Yet, suddenly, Graham Norton has been installed as favourite to anchor the show. Why? What is wrong with two women hosting on Saturday prime time — or do Moore’s principles only extend to hitching a ride on the latest bandwagon?  Damian Collins (Conservative, Folkestone and Hythe) submitted a private member’s bill to the House of Commons last week calling for an extension to football’s fit and proper persons’ test. As the one that exists would appear to be worthless, following the decision of Tim Kerr QC to overturn the Football League’s ban on Massimo Cellino buying Leeds United, he has his work cut out, but still. Collins would give the Football Association power to reject any owner whose influence would not be healthy for the game. Corrupt or untrustworthy people could be banned, whether or not they can skirt around the official criteria.  Convicted fraudster: Massimo Cellino is the new owner of Leeds United despite a chequered past   Expenses cheat: Maria Miller gave a 32-second apology in the House of Parliament for overclaiming mortgage costs  A fine idea, but why stop there? Corrupt or untrustworthy people who inexplicably escape significant official sanction exist in every walk of life. Say one became Minister for Culture, Media and Sport, for instance. Say that person was the type who fiddled her expenses, attempted to use her power and influence to bully the watchdog conducting the investigation into  her offence and even had a two-bob lickspittle making threats to journalists working on the story? Well, that sort of person is the last that should be in authority, and we could act accordingly. It really is a super idea. Unless, of course, Collins knows the separation in principle between Cellino, convicted fraudster and now owner of Leeds, and Maria Miller, exposed expenses cheat and Minister for Culture, Media and Sport. ‘Capable of using every kind of deception,’ the arrest  warrant said of Cellino. And the difference is?   More...

That third-minute penalty. Edin Dzeko goes past Southampton defender Jose Fonte at pace. He beats him so comprehensively that he actually runs outside Fonte, who now has his back to the player. So Fonte sticks out a leg behind him, as if drawing it back to shoot, and brings down Dzeko. This is the judgment call that Pochettino finds so objectionable. </font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">‘I don’t think you can give a penalty like that after just two minutes,’ he says. It’s an interesting take on the laws of the game. Anything goes, as long as it happens early enough. Kick who you like, trip who you like, just make sure you get it done quick. Football for 80 minutes, Rollerball the first 10. </font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Inexplicable, Pochettino called the penalty.

In a key revelation from the time, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore explained what would have happened had West Ham not lied about the third party ownership portion of Tevez’s contract and instead presented it to the league. Nothing. </font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Tevez would still have been registered a West Ham player before the transfer deadline, would still have been free to make his debut that weekend, but then on Monday, the league’s lawyers and the club’s representatives would have met and redrafted the contract in a form that was acceptable. They would have facilitated West Ham’s aim.</font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">This is not Scudamore’s fault. He is employed by the 20 Premier League chairmen and provides the service they desire. If they wanted a tough administrator, he could be that, too. They don’t.

There was genuine deception over Tevez, whereas what happened with Ji Dong-won seems more of a cock-up, but the response is the same. Just as the independent adjudicators did not want to take points from West Ham — or Sheffield United, Watford, Manchester United and Everton, who all entered into gentleman’s agreements amounting to third-party interference that season — so Sunderland’s punishment was kept under wraps, and was met by writing an insubstantial cheque.</font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">An easy solution would be simple, and finite. Every match that Tevez played, every match that Ji Dong-won played, three points awarded to the opposition. Sunderland were so poor at the start of the season that they would only be a point worse off — and opponents Southampton’s two additional points would not alter their League position at all. Yet, the League did not know this at the time. </font><br/></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">They were gambling that this would not come back to haunt them, as it did with Tevez.

When I was growing up, it seemed like nearly every team had a powerful centre-forward leading the line. Graeme Sharp and Andy Gray, for instance, were the spearheads of the Everton team I watched but plenty of other clubs went to war with imposing main strikers. Football has changed since then. Forwards are quick, nimble; the emphasis is on pace and movement. So when you get a striker who is a throwback to a different era, one who is big, strong and aggressive, defenders struggle to cope with the challenge.  Double act: Andy Gray and Graeme Sharp both scored as Everton saw off Watford to win the FA Cup in 1984   Strike force: Sharp and Gray were only together at Everton for two seasons, but the club won the FA Cup, the First Division title and the Cup-Winners\' Cup in that spell  More... Merseyside has got its swagger back as Liverpool and Everton fly high in the Premier League \'We can stop him!\' Liverpool boss Rodgers insists his Reds defence will cope with West Ham striker Carroll West Ham would be chasing Europe if Carroll had been fit all season, claims Allardyce as he eyes Liverpool upset The view from Liverpool: The five reasons why the Reds WILL win the title Ayre relaxed over offering Rodgers a new deal at title-chasing Reds Liverpool might be the best team in the world on current form, says West Ham owner Sullivan... but we won\'t roll over I saw that in Andy Carroll when I watched West Ham beat Sunderland on Monday. When he is on song, Andy can be unplayable and there was a great scene after he had scored his goal of him wheeling away to celebrate as two defenders lay flat on their backs. It took me back to the days of the ‘battering rams’ and evoked memories of men such as Mick Harford and Duncan Ferguson, those who would launch themselves to get their head to a ball. Nobody would stand in their way. Trust me: those forwards are a nightmare to face. It’s impossible to enjoy a game when you have to mark them as it becomes a war of attrition. You are constantly grappling and you come off drained as it feels like all you have done is fight for headers. Martin Skrtel and Daniel Agger will know what is coming at Upton Park, as West Ham will look to get it wide, then get it in to Andy during a game that is crucial to Liverpool’s hopes of winning the Barclays Premier League.  A force to be reckoned with: Andy Carroll easily outmuscles Wes Brown and John O\'Shea to thump west Ham into the lead at Sunderland   Laid to waste: Brown is crestfallen alongside keeper Vito Mannone as powerhouse Carroll milks the applause   A nightmare to play against: Few would relish facing the likes of Mick Harford (left) or Duncan Ferguson Andy, no doubt, will believe he has a point to prove given how quickly Brendan Rodgers ended his time at Anfield — he only got two brief substitute appearances that amounted to 18 minutes — but the decision to move him on was in everyone’s best interests. Now, I want to make it clear I’ve no axe to grind with Andy. I found him to be a good lad and his spell at the club wasn’t without highlights. He did what every Liverpool No 9 should do and scored two  winning goals against Everton, including one at Wembley in the 2012 FA Cup semi-final. I wanted Liverpool to sign him, especially after he tormented our defence one day at St James’ Park. If we could have got him for between £12-15m, it would have been good business. The feeling around the club when we were in for him was that maybe he could mature into our Didier Drogba.  Up against it: Martin Skrtel (left) and Daniel Agger (right) will know they are in for a battle at Upton Park   Luxury purchase: Carroll marked his debut in a Merseyside derby with a goal, but it was one of few highlights after Kenny Dalglish opted to spend £35m for his services   Wembley winner: Carroll rose highest in the 87th minute to clinch a pulsating contest in Liverpool\'s favour  More from Jamie Carragher...   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Sterling, Barkley and Januzaj are included but who else makes my list of top young players this season? 11/04/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Hillsborough - every child must be told why games kick off seven minutes late this weekend 11/04/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: We thought Carroll would be Liverpool\'s Drogba... but his £35m price tag gave him no chance 04/04/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: After QPR turned down Zlatan, here\'s my top five stars who got away 28/03/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Everyone used to fear them, but Arsenal now have no pace or power 28/03/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Moyes faces a big dilemma over how he gets the best out of United\'s £37m man Mata 21/03/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Ronaldo needs a Zidane moment to become a true great 21/03/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER EXCLUSIVE: Beating United at Old Trafford was twice as good as 2009... this would be up there with the glory days of Shankly and Paisley 17/03/14   JAMIE CARRAGHER: Premier League title would be Gerrard’s reward for staying loyal 14/03/14   VIEW FULL ARCHIVE Unfortunately, though, Liverpool’s decision to pay £35million was a big mistake and it never did Andy any favours. He started well, with two goals against Manchester City on his first start, but it quickly became apparent he wasn’t the right fit for the club. In training, he’d complain if the ball was not flung into the box — and I don’t mean from out wide. He wanted the ball to come in to him from close to the halfway line, but at Liverpool that was never going to happen. There were other things. He found the intensity of playing three games every week difficult. Before he might have been used to getting himself right for a match on a Saturday, then spending time socially with his mates — as we all did when we were young — but  at Liverpool the training and  professional demands are relentless. He would very rarely complete a full week on the training field at Melwood and, eventually, that takes a toll. If you aren’t fully conditioned, you are susceptible to injuries and Andy suffered his fair share.Another major issue was the fact he lacked pace. He suits the way Sam Allardyce operates and is West Ham’s focal point but at Liverpool that would never have been the case. Andy may feel Brendan made the decision about him too quickly but it was the right call. How he performs at Upton Park will be intriguing. Allardyce will wind Andy up to deliver a big effort,  primarily to get the win that will secure West Ham’s safety but also to fire out a message to Roy Hodgson with the World Cup in mind.  Legendary status: Carroll was purchased to become Liverpool\'s Didier Drogba, but ended up being sold to West Ham at a £20m loss   Taking its toll: Carroll would rarely complete a week of training at Liverpool, opening himself up to injury problems   Relentless: Carroll (left, with Carragher, Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard) struggled with the demands of training and the intensity of playing three times a week at Liverpool  Allardyce believes Andy will make it ‘impossible for Roy Hodgson to ignore him’ if he reproduces his  finish to last season when scoring six goals in 13 games and he is  moving towards that ratio with two goals in his last five appearances. Personally I believe Rickie Lambert would be closer to the fourth  striker’s spot at the moment, if England’s head coach wants to bring a different kind of player. I think Lambert offers more goals and another string to his bow is his outstanding penalty record. It makes me smile when  I hear people mention him as a ‘plan B’ to go more direct. Do other countries have this ‘plan B’ when things aren’t going well?  In the wilderness? Carroll won the last of his 9 England caps in the 5-0 rout of San Marino in October 2012   Strong option: Rickie Lambert (left) is a better all-round choice to be England\'s fourth striker  Should Andy stay fit and score a few more goals then maybe he will sway Hodgson, who saw him score a brilliant header against Sweden during Euro 2012. The big challenge, however, is for Andy to start playing football consistently. Three of his last four seasons have been ruined by injury and he doesn’t want to be remembered for his fitness record. He is 25 and to get to the highest levels again, he has to realise the importance of looking after himself. Should Andy do that, he’ll have every chance of becoming a true No 9.   Rafa got a lot more out of Torres  Jose Mourinho\'s decision to play without a striker in Paris, followed by his comments after that defeat, clearly spells the end of the road for Chelsea’s frontmen. I have said regularly this season that Chelsea have been playing with 10 men, as Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto’o and Demba Ba have lacked consistency. Torres and Ba have rarely come up with crucial goals and while Eto’o has scored against Liverpool and Manchester United, he hasn’t done enough for a club with Chelsea’s ambitions. It is no wonder Mourinho is looking at signing Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa.  Stony faced: A gloomy Fernando Torres (second left) sits alongside Demba Ba on Chelsea\'s bench during the midweek misery in Paris   Stunted: Torres takes on former Chelsea player Alex during his poor 31-minute appearance  What will be interesting now, though, is how Torres, Eto’o and Ba react in the closing weeks of the campaign. Chelsea still have a chance to win the Barclays Premier League and I don’t think they are completely out of the Champions League, despite losing 3-1 to Paris Saint-Germain. It was a big call for Mourinho to be so blunt at such a crucial time, as he will need Torres, Eto’o or Ba to produce something for him. They may have under-performed but has Mourinho done enough to get the best out of them? Rafa Benitez, it should be remembered, certainly got more out of Torres and Ba than Mourinho has. The question now is whether Chelsea’s manager will be able to get a response when he really needs it.    My top five players I wish we\'d got to see... Zlatan Ibrahimovic insisted this week he had no regrets about never playing in the Barclays Premier League, but I think it’s a shame he hasn’t taken the chance to test himself in England. There are a few other players, too, who I would have loved to have seen enticed here. 1 Ronaldinho Manchester United tried to sign him from Paris Saint-Germain in 2003 and it would have been fascinating to see how Ronaldinho adapted to the challenge of our league. Instead he chose Barcelona, where he became the best player in the world.  Moving on: Ronaldinho opted to join Barcelona from Paris Saint-Germain, but how the Brazilian fared in the Premier League would have been fascinating to watch  VIDEO: Watch Ronaldinho\'s highlights from PSG  2 Luis Figo I played alongside him last month in a charity match but the Portugal legend could have been my team-mate at Anfield in 2005. Not long after we had won the Champions League, Rafa Benitez thought he had secured a move for him from Real Madrid but Figo ended up at Inter Milan.  Kop out: Luis Figo nearly joined Liverpool from Real Madrid, but chose Inter Milan instead  VIDEO: Watch Figo\'s best moments from Madrid  3 Paolo Maldini One of the things I admire about Maldini is how he gave his career solely to AC Milan but I’d have loved to have seen him in England. When Gianluca Vialli was Chelsea manager, he tried to lure his old international team-mate from the San Siro and was almost successful.  One club man: Paolo Maldini (right) spent his entire career at the San Siro  VIDEO: Watch Maldini\'s highlights reel from his glittering career at AC Milan  4 Xavi When I met Xavi in Madrid last month, he spoke with great enthusiasm about the Premier League and his admiration for the English game. He also indicated that he received offers — Manchester United had a strong interest — but he wanted to stay true to Barcelona.  Aficionado: Xavi is a keen follower of English football, and lists Matthew Le Tissier as one of his footballing heroes  VIDEO: Watch Xavi in action for Barcelona  5 Gianluigi Buffon He was recognised as the best goalkeeper in the world for many years and is a Juventus icon. There was a point, though, when all was not well for Buffon in Turin and he was linked with Manchester City.  He would certainly have added to the quality of our game.  Read all about it: Gigi Buffon was linked with a move to Manchester City and would have been a surefire hit in England  VIDEO: Watch a selection of Buffon\'s best saves    More...

He started well, with two goals against Manchester City on his first start, but it quickly became apparent he wasn’t the right fit for the club.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">In training, he’d complain if the ball was not flung into the box — and I don’t mean from out wide. He wanted the ball to come in to him from close to the halfway line, but at Liverpool that was never going to happen. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">There were other things. He found the intensity of playing three games every week difficult. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Before he might have been used to getting himself right for a match on a Saturday, then spending time socially with his mates — as we all did when we were young — but  at Liverpool the training and  professional demands are relentless.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">He would very rarely complete a full week on the training field at Melwood and, eventually, that takes a toll. If you aren’t fully conditioned, you are susceptible to injuries and Andy suffered his fair share.<br/>Another major issue was the fact he lacked pace. He suits the way Sam Allardyce operates and is West Ham’s focal point but at Liverpool that would never have been the case. Andy may feel Brendan made the decision about him too quickly but it was the right call. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">How he performs at Upton Park will be intriguing. Allardyce will wind Andy up to deliver a big effort,  primarily to get the win that will secure West Ham’s safety but also to fire out a message to Roy Hodgson with the World Cup in mind.</font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Legendary status: Carroll was purchased to become Liverpool\'s Didier Drogba, but ended up being sold to West Ham at a £20m loss\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"375\" id=\"i-5f520d5f\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/04/article-0-1322EDBD000005DC-747_634x375.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Legendary status: Carroll was purchased to become Liverpool\'s Didier Drogba, but ended up being sold to West Ham at a £20m loss</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Taking its toll: Carroll would rarely complete a week of training at Liverpool, opening himself up to injury problems\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"364\" id=\"i-5b970d28\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/04/article-0-1CD7098200000578-613_634x364.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Taking its toll: Carroll would rarely complete a week of training at Liverpool, opening himself up to injury problems</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Relentless: Carroll (left, with Carragher, Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard) struggled with the demands of training and the intensity of playing three times a week at Liverpool\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"414\" id=\"i-5d4b0d37\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/04/article-0-1CD709D700000578-417_634x414.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Relentless: Carroll (left, with Carragher, Joe Cole and Steven Gerrard) struggled with the demands of training and the intensity of playing three times a week at Liverpool</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Allardyce believes Andy will make it ‘impossible for Roy Hodgson to ignore him’ if he reproduces his  finish to last season when scoring six goals in 13 games and he is  moving towards that ratio with two goals in his last five appearances.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Personally I believe Rickie Lambert would be closer to the fourth  striker’s spot at the moment, if England’s head coach wants to bring a different kind of player. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">I think Lambert offers more goals and another string to his bow is his outstanding penalty record.</font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It makes me smile when  I hear people mention him as a ‘plan B’ to go more direct.

Should he have minded his own business when asked about his successor; or do United fans have short memories? All will be revealed below. But first, a little touch of Frankie in the night. Rest in peace, Godfather of House.    Time for another change? After a season of poor results, Sir Alex Ferguson (left) has come under scrutiny for his recommendation of David Moyes (right) as his replacement at Manchester United last summer  Showing the strain: Michael Carrick, Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand have endured a tough time this term David Moyes reacting after each of United\'s 10 League losses     You continually take shots at Kenny Dalglish and it seems quite out of place. The Andy Carroll signing was a poor one, as it turned out, but this was primarily a result of Dalglish being released by the club and Carroll not being part of Brendan Rodgers\' plan. He was signed in the context of getting £15m more for Fernando Torres than they were paying for Carroll. They have recouped some of that money already and it will prove less of a loss, from a financial and PR point of view, than Torres will for Chelsea. Are you going to be similarly scathing about the signing of Marouane Fellaini, who has shown zero upside; or about the way the \'chosen one\' is leading Manchester United to their lowest finish in Premiership history? How about the way Dalglish took Liverpool to a trophy and a cup final in his one bad season – bad only by his very high standards. Moyes has a higher net spend than Dalglish in his second spell at Liverpool, took over the Champions and has no silverware to show for it. There’s some balance for you. Paul McCabe, Dundee  Paul, I don’t need lessons in balance from someone who cannot admit that Dalglish was sacked by Liverpool. Doves get released, mate. Prison inmates get released. Kenny got the bullet. There were two pieces in Monday’s column that mentioned Dalglish, probably the first time I have referred to him this season. One noted his achievements as player, manager and man and the love for him at Anfield, no matter the odd mistake in his second managerial spell; the other took issue with his assertion that Sam Allardyce needed greater financial support from the West Ham United board and ‘better players’ – considering that two of those players, Carroll and Stewart Downing, were bought by Dalglish at Liverpool for £55m. I’d say that is balance. I thought Kenny made an inconsistent argument regarding Allardyce, much like yours over Carroll. He worked out as a £20m loss for Liverpool and that is not excused by Torres’s failure at Chelsea or Fellaini’s at Manchester United. As for Moyes, he’s hardly getting an easy ride; least of all over Fellaini.  Released or sacked: Kenny Dalglish pictured in the Anfield stands with Ian Rush last Sunday Difficult ride: Marouane Fellaini, who cost £28.5m last summer, has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford      It is Sir Alex Ferguson’s fault. He knew an aging team over-achieved last season, so thought he could drop them and make himself look great. Scouseblue, Liverpool He didn’t need that last title to look great. What went before had pretty much guaranteed that epitaph. And every team is aging. The word you are looking for is old, and United are not actually old. David De Gea, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Rafael, Danny Welbeck, Wilfried Zaha and Tom Cleverley are not old, and this year Moyes has introduced Adnan Januzaj. You may think they are not good enough – but they’re not old.  Despite Ferguson’s fantastic record over the years, it doesn\'t change the fact he is to blame for the current situation. He let the squad stagnate for five years and played with a big hole in midfield. He should have replaced Roy Keane and Paul Scholes and instead was an apologist for the Glazers by claiming repeatedly there was no value in the transfer market. The centre backs were aging yet he didn\'t bother buying replacements for Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic. In the past he had his eye on the future and replaced players well before they were past their best, but didn\'t bother as he was going to retire. Then he made a terrible mistake by appointing Moyes. So whose fault is it? Nobody is perfect, not even Ferguson. He is not beyond criticism. All around were buying class players and have overtaken us. Nick63 Menston, Leeds Jones and Smalling were bought to replace Vidic and Ferdinand, and I would imagine Shinji Kagawa was seen as key to reinventing midfield creativity following the retirement of Scholes. Good luck finding that replacement for Roy Keane, though, because I don’t see one at too many other clubs, either. Fernandinho at Manchester City, perhaps. Most likely, Ferguson did not see the crash coming because he got extraordinary levels of performance from his players, so did not realise their weakness in the hands of another manager. I don’t know why it has to be somebody’s fault all of the time. At worst, Ferguson recommended the wrong man – but he did so with the best intentions.  Forward planning: United have not properly replaced centre-back pairing Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, according to some   Replacement: Phil Jones was signed to be United\'s centre-back in the long-term   Compared to Paris St Germain, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, United have done nothing over the past three years to build strength. This was on Ferguson’s watch and he must take 100 per cent responsibility for this dismal and pathetic team. Angst06, TorontoThe dismal and pathetic team that came close to beating Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, you mean? That dismal and pathetic team? Bayern Munich are currently taking advantage of a spell in which their academy has produced a clutch of world-class players, as happened to Manchester United two decades ago; PSG and Manchester City have limitless funds under Gulf ownership. Despite this, Manchester United are the reigning champions. That was on Ferguson’s watch; or have you forgotten already?  The problem with the poll regarding who is to blame for Manchester United\'s current situation is that it deals in absolutes. There is no single reason for their problems, but a variety of different elements combining to make it a really tough season for whoever took charge. What manager at the end of any campaign could say that no area of his team needed improvement? Ideally, Ferguson would have let Moyes know much earlier that he would be the next manager leading to a smoother transition. I guess he just wasn\'t willing to take the risk of it leaking and potentially ruining his final season. Jbers, France Ferguson always regretted prematurely announcing his intention to retire at the end of the 2001-02 season. He thought the players switched off, and he couldn’t stand the idea of Sven Goran Eriksson reaping the benefit of his good work, so changed his mind. Without doubt his plans were kept under wraps this time to avoid a repeat.  Why not me? Sven Goran Eriksson was lined up to replace Sir Alex Ferguson back in 2002   You wrote: ‘Some would say he picked the wrong manager, but he didn’t. He just picked the wrong club; one with very short memories and a well-honed sense of entitlement.’ Correction, Mr Samuel: Ferguson picked the right club, you just happen to be listening to the wrong fans. If, as you say, 25 per cent are blaming Sir Alex, then I and the other 75 per cent need to continue the vocal support we witnessed at Old Trafford on Saturday. United we stand, divided we fall. Babs7Falmouth, Truro United we stand, divided we’re lumbered. My favourite line from Performance, and there are a few contenders, some of which you’ll find in the song below. (I take your point, by the way – 25 per cent is not a majority, but it’s still a significant number).    Not getting all the talk coming out of Old Trafford that the club is built on stability and they don\'t hire and fire. They had one manager for nearly three decades winning a trophy if not every year then pretty close to it – so of course you are going to have stability. They should have gone for Carlo Ancelotti, he was the perfect fit for United, a manager that works well with all players and clearly wasn\'t comfortable at Paris St Germain last summer. Ancelotti’s teams play good football and he is a proven winner. SpannersXI, CoventryI agree about Ancelotti being a good fit. My information is that he wins the league, or Champions League, at Real Madrid this summer or is sacked. If that happens, he should be on the radar of a number of English clubs – most particularly Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur if they decide to change. He is a healing type, too, not the sort to come in at Old Trafford and create turmoil.  Good fit: Carlo Ancelotti could be brought in at the end of the season if United decide to dispense with Moyes   Moyes got the job at Everton because he was recommended by his predecessor, Walter Smith, he was also offered a job on the Old Trafford coaching staff by Ferguson but preferred to be a manager. He is well thought of in the coaching fraternity and a couple of years ago even Arsene Wenger stated that he thought Moyes one of our best. Bill, United Kingdom You’re right. If Ferguson made a mistake there are a few that would have followed him down that road – some of the best judges in the game, in fact.  Maybe the fans are blaming Ferguson for leaving Moyes with an aging squad who are coming to the end of their contracts at the club? Maybe they are blaming him for the lack of real investment in the squad over the last few seasons of his reign? He relied on Scholes and Ryan Giggs in midfield and never replaced them, and at the end of this season three out of four first team defenders are probably off elsewhere. Rhod, Wrexham, 1 day ago The average age of the team that beat Aston Villa 4-1 was 26, after substitutions it was still 26 and the average age of the bench, which included 40-year-old Giggs, was 27. This aging squad is a myth. You’ll find these false presumptions occurring throughout football. Say it enough times and everybody believes it.  The veteran: Despite the presence of 40-year-old Ryan Giggs, United\'s squad still has a relatively young average age   United need a major overhaul, let Moyes do it, then judge. Enjoy the past glories and memories, we all do and share those with United fans, but the future needs change. Every team has to go through it so stop the whining guys and get on with the planning for next year and beyond. Wbafan, Canada Sage advice from a West Bromwich Albion fan living in Canada. Do you want me to deal with this, or is it over to you? I’m feeling generous, you have this one. Try to keep it clean.  For the world\'s biggest club to have no succession plan is farcical. Everyone knew it was just a matter of time before Ferguson retired. Disgraceful and embarrassing incompetence from the owners and the board. Stretfordhead, Texas They did have a succession plan, mate. He’s called David Moyes. Just because you don’t rate him doesn’t mean it wasn’t a plan.  The plan: United handed David Moyes a six-year contract and a brief to take United forward post-Ferguson   No right minded United fan would ever direct ire at Ferguson in his retirement. Every fan base has their idiots, without exception. It is myopic to focus on a handful of disgruntled supporters, fresh from another home humiliation. What happened in the home game that following the comprehensive 3-0 battering by Manchester City? The 70,000 in Old Trafford gave a rapturous supportive ovation to their beleaguered manager and were unanimous in their choral condemnation of that silly plane. It is difficult to imagine the fans of clubs with comparable status such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich maintaining comparable sympathy for their manager if they were seventh in their league with scant chance of Champions League football next season. All of the support for Moyes is a proxy support of Ferguson. It is because Ferguson chose him that they maintain the respect for Moyes. It\'s certainly not for his promising previous achievements or exciting, expansive football. United fans standing by Moyes is perhaps the greatest testament to the support of Ferguson, more real than any road or statue. It is blind, unquestioning faith in his final instruction \"your job now is to support your new manager\". According to market research company Kantar, United have a total worldwide fan base of 659 million. How many fans were polled by the Manchester Evening News? If we\'re generous and say 50,000, then the 12,500 fans that blame Ferguson for the current predicament comprise 0.0018 per cent of the fan pool. If this is the metric by which our most respected sports journalists can muse indignantly on the over entitled I-phone generation may I direct them to Twitter? How about radio phone-ins? I\'ve heard several Liverpool fans call for Brendan Rodgers\' head this season after a single poor result. Basing your opinion on the ravings of a silly minority is puzzling. Was the enemy not within when Roy Hodgson got the boot from Anfield? He was appointed in July 2010 and was out by January 2011. Hodgson said of Liverpool’s fans: “The famous Anfield support has not really been there.” Moyes was appointed in July 2013 and is still there despite doing a worse job than Hodgson. Moyes said of United fans: “The crowds have been incredible. I\'m not feeling any pressure from inside the club. It\'s all coming from you people [the media].\" Yet it\'s United fans that have no class according to some. The Henery, PortsmouthSpot on. Chrism, ManchesterNo, it isn’t actually, Chris. Take the 0.0018 per cent of the fan pool statistic. It only works if we believe that just under 10 per cent of the world’s population are Manchester United fans. Equally, say we accept 659 million is genuine figure; then on the law of average roughly a quarter of them – close to 165 million – are currently blaming Ferguson. The Hodgson quote is taken from after he was sacked; the Moyes quote while he remains in the job and is desperate for the fans to back him. It is no surprise that they are different in attitude. If Moyes goes in the summer, he might have a more self-pitying take on the pressure he was under. As for the assertion that no United fan would ever blame Ferguson, that simply isn’t true. I go through many comments to produce this debate column – and there is plenty of criticism of Ferguson out there, and not all coming from shallow, aggrieved citizens of Singapore and Chicago who thought the good times would never end. I think the reaction to the plane was less vindication for Moyes, more embarrassment at a stunt that did not reflect well on the supporters, who vocally distanced themselves from it. I do agree, though, that it is only Ferguson’s backing for Moyes and the fans devotion to Ferguson that has prevented the atmosphere becoming more febrile this season.  I think the worst of it may well be over for Moyes and the bulk of the supporters stayed with him, which is admirable, but if he gets this much-vaunted £200m in the summer, it will be interesting to see how long that backing lasts if United are still a conservative team next season.  Unquestioning loyalty: The vast majority of Manchester United supporters continue to have faith in Moyes Show of support: The Chosen One banner hanging from the upper tier of the Stretford End   This is what Roy Hodgson said when he got the job: \'I know Sir Alex is not really a Liverpool man, so I’m a bit concerned about my excellent relationship with him. I sincerely hope he forgives me for moving north and hopefully we can have a glass of wine together, maybe in secret. I hope that’s how he is going to see it.\' He was never a Liverpool manager. Suckdaroot, Old Oswestry No, he was a Liverpool manager who did not understand the rules of engagement in the north-west. Ferguson did, Rafael Benitez did, Brendan Rodgers does, David Moyes doesn’t, strangely. Hodgson didn’t think the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United mattered, he thought his friendship with Ferguson was more important than any petty enmity. In displaying this attitude he alienated Liverpool’s fans. Benitez got it straight away, and so did Rodgers by pouncing on Moyes when he said Liverpool were favourites to win at Old Trafford. I think Roy is a very decent guy and there were more valid reasons to criticise him at Liverpool than his relationship with a rival. I think it says a lot for him that he didn’t feel it mattered. Football has always been tribal, but now it’s like the Khmer Rouge. No other viewpoint is acceptable.  United fans are not responsible for camera close-ups of Ferguson’s face each time we concede. The soap opera of the master being in the stands looking down on his chosen apprentice is a storyline that Sky and BT have perpetuated since the beginning of the season. Headjack, Manchester I realise that. I was linking the events because obviously that story-line is also influenced by the discontent around the Moyes reign. I wasn’t suggesting United fans are directly responsible for the camera shots. Anyway, talking of jack, here’s Frankie again. It doesn’t get any better than this. Really it doesn’t.   Focus of attention: Sir Alex Ferguson is picked out in the Old Trafford crowd at every match   Sunday Supplement on Sky, March 30, 2014. “We need Moyes to succeed, if he fails that will just give credence to the clubs that hire successful overseas managers rather than recruit from the Premier League.”  Well, stuff you lot - United should not be a reporters project and Moyes should be judged by his current results, not the results from a mid-table club now doing better than United. This is not the first time this statement has been made on Sunday Supplement, and it is why the press are easy on Moyes. Little Helper, Boston That quote wasn’t mine. I’m on Sunday Supplement about as often as Jim Davidson gets invited on Loose Women. I’m a guest this weekend for the first time since January 26 and the occasion before was November 17. I accept though that the line about needing Moyes to succeed to advance the cause of British managers is a familiar one, and I certainly felt that way at the start of the season. Less so now, though. The job Brendan Rodgers has done at Liverpool shows what can be achieved with a progressive British coach, and the failure of imported managers at the bottom of the Premier League table is rather underlining the suspicion that even Jose Mourinho and Rafael Benitez might not have been so eye-catching had they been lumbered with Fulham and Sunderland mid-season. And, in truth, just because Pepe Mel is making hard work of West Brom it doesn’t make all Spanish coaches useless; so whatever happens to Moyes at Old Trafford should not reflect on British managers. A passport never won the title.  The fact that the MEN poll included Ferguson in the list of people to blame for United’s plight means that the media have also identified him as a potential guilty party. Ferguson should recommend the removal of Moyes at the end of the season: it will surely go on record as one of his best moves. Redtothebones, Mauritius If Ferguson made a big play of removing Moyes, who would want to work for United under that pressure; the former manager up in the stands like a Roman Emperor, thumbs up or thumbs down.  The majority of fans were against the Chosen One banner being put up and even more against that embarrassing plane effort. JB, Manchester Here’s an idea. Why not go along, wear your colours, cheer or boo as you see fit, and don’t let the making and display of banners ruin your lives?  The problem is a generation of United fans know nothing but success, have never suffered with their team and don\'t know how to deal with a transitional phase. The sad truth is had Ferguson stayed another year and the team suffered this way they would probably have turned on him and said it was time to go. For that reason alone I\'m glad he left at the very top where he belonged. Steviejay99, Colchester Me too, Steve. There are not many great managers that bow out in style like Sir Alex. Remember.  Sad farewell: Brian Clough\'s final match saw Nottingham Forest relegated from the Premier League    The fact remains Ferguson was consulted and gave the most asinine advice ever: pick Moyes. Not only that, knowing it was going to be his last season, he went for the title, rather than planning and investing for the future. Although welcome in the short term, that victory will hurt United in the middle and maybe even long term as they try to rebuild. Vadid1, London Yes, I can just imagine that speech to the faithful. \'Well, lads, having seen Manchester City win the title and having to suck that raw all summer, I think it’s fair to tell you that I’ll be letting them win it again this season because I’m going to plan for the future. And then I’m off. So, don’t worry. If anyone asks why we let Robin van Persie sign for City and send them 20 points clear by March, just tell them it’s all under control and we weren’t trying to win the league this season anyway. I’ll be telling the players that, too, so don’t worry if some of them start knocking off a bit early. It’s all part of the plan.\' What a fool, Fergie, eh? He only tried to win the league instead.  The media and supporters have been talking about Moyes as Ferguson’s successor for years. Henry, Colchester I know. He was the Chosen One a long time before there was a banner about it.  Let\'s get serious. Moyes is considering making Rooney captain? Rooney is good at his job, scoring goals, but he\'s about as much captaincy material as I\'m an Eskimo with a herd of camels parked in the drive. Scooter, Norwich Come on Sheikh Abdullah Eeyeekalduk Wentshukumishiteu Al-Ghamdi. We know it’s you. And, frankly, you need to sort those camels out or we’ll never get the van parked.  Captaincy material? Wayne Rooney should be unburdened by responsibility and concentrate on scoring goals   Now Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, has acknowledged it costs the business lots of money when Manchester United fail, those 20 titles are questionable. The Premier League can be equated with US wrestling. Charlesang, SingaporeI spoke to Richard on Monday. His explanation is that he got tucked up by a South African reporter, who ignored his initial answer to the question, ‘Is United’s failure bad for the Premier League?’ Richard says his answer was, ‘No.’ He then went on to explain that continued failure could cost United overseas fans, but that in his experience those supporters would be picked up by other clubs, such as Chelsea, which is what happened with Liverpool and Manchester United. He said the reporter selected his quotes to make it appear as if he was saying the League needed United to be successful. I have no confirmation either way. All I would say is that, as I put in my little commentary, I have known Richard for a long time and he is far from stupid. I was genuinely surprised that he would have endorsed United in this way.  Ferguson could have overseen the new management with certain stipulations, such as not letting the back room team leave. Dastardly, Thailand That would have been a poor start: appointing a manager and then choosing his staff.  I seem to remember Ferguson’s camp claiming to the press that he was single-handedly responsible for choosing Moyes. Now he wants distance from that choice. This is getting more embarrassing by the day. Onegoal, Manchester Camp? What camp? I imagine the line about Ferguson’s role in Moyes appointment came from a briefing by the club. And he is not distancing himself from the decision; far from it.  Stay or go: Some have suggested that Moyes should have retained Ferguson\'s former assistant Mike Phelan   The really big question is how Ferguson got every referee under his thumb. There should be an independent inquiry into why Moyes has already had more penalties against his side at Old Trafford than Ferguson did during his whole reign. That is of course statistically impossible and in horse racing would result in a stewards inquiry if not a Royal Commission but in the strange world of football – nothing. Ericjimbob, Tunbridge WellsAnd do you know why Ericjimbob? Because as a piece of information, it’s cobblers. United have had three penalties awarded against them in the league this season; compared to six under Ferguson in 2010-11 or five in 2006-07. In his last 11 seasons, Ferguson had 26 penalties awarded against Manchester United in the Premier League. Those are the facts; but here’s Bill with an equally valid theory-based explanation. The more time you spend defending your own penalty area, the more penalties you concede and the more time you spend attacking the other penalty area the more you win. So under Moyes, a weaker United are conceding more penalties and winning fewer. Bill, Barnsley, 1 day ago  The most frustrating thing is that there is absolutely nothing that Moyes has done that indicates progress. Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool showed straight away what his philosophy was. Moyes has no real style of play. What are we working towards exactly? Who do we need to buy to play the Moyes way? It’s all very worrying. Dan The Man, Manchester I can see that Dan. I thought United did well against Bayern Munich, but that type of stoicism is not really a game plan for the Premier League. And now, a Voice of Reason – and a final word from Frankie. RIP.   Given time and patience it will come right. Anyone who has followed United for decades and seen how things have changed since the Glazers took over will know just how much Ferguson has done to keep things sane in insane times. Miracles even. When Moyes was at Everton, everyone to a man said he was a great manager and deserved a big club. He has that now and I trust Ferguson. The Vimto Kid, Gastley Like a cool summer breeze wasn’t it? Ah well. Back to the madhouse.  Moyes has done a horrid job at United. From his ridiculously long vacation, to the naive transfer summer, to the backroom staff, to the defensive and negative football, to the complete lack of tactical nous, to the embarrassing team selections, to the remarkably bad substitutions, to the defeatist interviews, to the pampering of Rooney, to the training methods, to the weak man-management, the man has no plan. I have few heroes and Sir Alex is one of them. This doesn\'t mean he is impervious to criticism. The last few years his tactics became more pragmatic. He didn\'t give young talent enough of a chance. He didn\'t replace the old guard. He didn\'t address the glaring midfield problem. Lastly, he appointed Moyes. A bizarre choice. No level headed United supporter expected a trophy this season or the next, but we expected positive and attractive football. Finishing seventh is also unacceptable for a club of United\'s size and stature. King Cantona, Oslo It is amazing Manchester United even make it to matches without being run over by the team bus or locked in the training ground by mistake with such a band of incompetents in charge. Good shout on his poor training methods, though. That must be a hell of a set of binoculars you’ve got in Oslo.  The Manchester Evening News ran another poll in 1995 after Ferguson sold Mark Hughes, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis and a majority of fans wanted the manager sacked. Turns out it was hijacked by Manchester City fans. Tom, London Or imbeciles, Tom. Don’t rule out imbeciles. They’re a very strong lobby.  Put to the vote: A 1995 poll after United sold Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis (below) found that a majority of fans wanted Alex Ferguson sacked      When Bill Shankly retired you did not see him walking the corridors of Anfield and since that day all who followed him at Liverpool did the same. Kenny Dalglish only came back because the club asked him to. It would have been better had Ferguson taken a year holiday from Old Trafford and let Moyes get on with it. The old fool wants to remain in his empire until the day he dies. Crazykopite, Thailand That’s a very rosy picture you paint, Crazy. Shankly wasn’t made particularly welcome at the Liverpool training ground, so took to hanging around places like Everton and Wrexham just to stay involved with football. Why should he go on a cruise for a year? Nobody has more right to watch a game at Old Trafford than Ferguson. Nobody.  He could have said: \'I trust you to make the right choice.\' Anonymous, London Why give a non-committal answer? He wanted to help.  Sir Alex Ferguson with Manchester United was like Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party. Both strong leaders who dominated and changed the landscape, but neither saw suitable successors and ultimately stayed too long. Pro Benitez Cult, North Korea Stayed too long? He won the league last year. BaggsyB, Luxembourg Yes, but don’t you understand Baggsy – he should have let that slide and planned for the future.  Shame on you Martin, a very disappointing page.

The Andy Carroll signing was a poor one, as it turned out, but this was primarily a result of Dalglish being released by the club and Carroll not being part of Brendan Rodgers\' plan. He was signed in the context of getting £15m more for Fernando Torres than they were paying for Carroll. They have recouped some of that money already and it will prove less of a loss, from a financial and PR point of view, than Torres will for Chelsea. Are you going to be similarly scathing about the signing of Marouane Fellaini, who has shown zero upside; or about the way the \'chosen one\' is leading Manchester United to their lowest finish in Premiership history? How about the way Dalglish took Liverpool to a trophy and a cup final in his one bad season – bad only by his very high standards. Moyes has a higher net spend than Dalglish in his second spell at Liverpool, took over the Champions and has no silverware to show for it. There’s some balance for you.<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> Paul McCabe, Dundee</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Paul, I don’t need lessons in balance from someone who cannot admit that Dalglish was sacked by Liverpool. Doves get released, mate. Prison inmates get released. Kenny got the bullet. There were two pieces in Monday’s column that mentioned Dalglish, probably the first time I have referred to him this season. One noted his achievements as player, manager and man and the love for him at Anfield, no matter the odd mistake in his second managerial spell; the other took issue with his assertion that Sam Allardyce needed greater financial support from the West Ham United board and ‘better players’ – considering that two of those players, Carroll and Stewart Downing, were bought by Dalglish at Liverpool for £55m. I’d say that is balance. I thought Kenny made an inconsistent argument regarding Allardyce, much like yours over Carroll. He worked out as a £20m loss for Liverpool and that is not excused by Torres’s failure at Chelsea or Fellaini’s at Manchester United. As for Moyes, he’s hardly getting an easy ride; least of all over Fellaini.</span></font></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Released or sacked: Kenny Dalglish pictured in the Anfield stands with Ian Rush last Sunday\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"450\" id=\"i-9ccb0e38\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CB3B13700000578-44_634x450.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Released or sacked: Kenny Dalglish pictured in the Anfield stands with Ian Rush last Sunday</p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Difficult ride: Marouane Fellaini, who cost £28.5m last summer, has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"459\" id=\"i-ac950e87\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CBF492D00000578-104_634x459.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Difficult ride: Marouane Fellaini, who cost £28.5m last summer, has struggled to make an impact at Old Trafford</p> </div><p> </p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">It is Sir Alex Ferguson’s fault. He knew an aging team over-achieved last season, so thought he could drop them and make himself look great. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Scouseblue, Liverpool</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">He didn’t need that last title to look great. What went before had pretty much guaranteed that epitaph. And every team is aging. The word you are looking for is old, and United are not actually old. David De Gea, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Rafael, Danny Welbeck, Wilfried Zaha and Tom Cleverley are not old, and this year Moyes has introduced Adnan Januzaj. You may think they are not good enough – but they’re not old.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Despite Ferguson’s fantastic record over the years, it doesn\'t change the fact he is to blame for the current situation. He let the squad stagnate for five years and played with a big hole in midfield. He should have replaced Roy Keane and Paul Scholes and instead was an apologist for the Glazers by claiming repeatedly there was no value in the transfer market. The centre backs were aging yet he didn\'t bother buying replacements for Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic. In the past he had his eye on the future and replaced players well before they were past their best, but didn\'t bother as he was going to retire. Then he made a terrible mistake by appointing Moyes. So whose fault is it? Nobody is perfect, not even Ferguson. He is not beyond criticism. All around were buying class players and have overtaken us. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Nick63 Menston, Leeds</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Jones and Smalling were bought to replace Vidic and Ferdinand, and I would imagine Shinji Kagawa was seen as key to reinventing midfield creativity following the retirement of Scholes. Good luck finding that replacement for Roy Keane, though, because I don’t see one at too many other clubs, either. Fernandinho at Manchester City, perhaps. Most likely, Ferguson did not see the crash coming because he got extraordinary levels of performance from his players, so did not realise their weakness in the hands of another manager. I don’t know why it has to be somebody’s fault all of the time. At worst, Ferguson recommended the wrong man – but he did so with the best intentions.</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Forward planning: United have not properly replaced centre-back pairing Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, according to some\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"447\" id=\"i-ac950e86\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CBF61B800000578-423_634x447.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Forward planning: United have not properly replaced centre-back pairing Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic, according to some</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Replacement: Phil Jones was signed to be United\'s centre-back in the long-term\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"473\" id=\"i-ab0e0e79\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CBF402900000578-654_634x473.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Replacement: Phil Jones was signed to be United\'s centre-back in the long-term</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Compared to Paris St Germain, Bayern Munich and Manchester City, United have done nothing over the past three years to build strength. This was on Ferguson’s watch and he must take 100 per cent responsibility for this dismal and pathetic team. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Angst06, Toronto</span></font><br/><br/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The dismal and pathetic team that came close to beating Bayern Munich on Tuesday night, you mean? That dismal and pathetic team? Bayern Munich are currently taking advantage of a spell in which their academy has produced a clutch of world-class players, as happened to Manchester United two decades ago; PSG and Manchester City have limitless funds under Gulf ownership. Despite this, Manchester United are the reigning champions. That was on Ferguson’s watch; or have you forgotten already?</font></span></p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The problem with the poll regarding who is to blame for Manchester United\'s current situation is that it deals in absolutes. There is no single reason for their problems, but a variety of different elements combining to make it a really tough season for whoever took charge. What manager at the end of any campaign could say that no area of his team needed improvement? Ideally, Ferguson would have let Moyes know much earlier that he would be the next manager leading to a smoother transition. I guess he just wasn\'t willing to take the risk of it leaking and potentially ruining his final season. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jbers, France</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Ferguson always regretted prematurely announcing his intention to retire at the end of the 2001-02 season. He thought the players switched off, and he couldn’t stand the idea of Sven Goran Eriksson reaping the benefit of his good work, so changed his mind. Without doubt his plans were kept under wraps this time to avoid a repeat. <br/></font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Why not me?

They had one manager for nearly three decades winning a trophy if not every year then pretty close to it – so of course you are going to have stability. They should have gone for Carlo Ancelotti, he was the perfect fit for United, a manager that works well with all players and clearly wasn\'t comfortable at Paris St Germain last summer. Ancelotti’s teams play good football and he is a proven winner. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">SpannersXI, Coventry</span></font><br/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br/><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">I agree about Ancelotti being a good fit. My information is that he wins the league, or Champions League, at Real Madrid this summer or is sacked. If that happens, he should be on the radar of a number of English clubs – most particularly Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur if they decide to change.

Maybe they are blaming him for the lack of real investment in the squad over the last few seasons of his reign? He relied on Scholes and Ryan Giggs in midfield and never replaced them, and at the end of this season three out of four first team defenders are probably off elsewhere. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rhod, Wrexham, 1 day ago</span></font></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">The average age of the team that beat Aston Villa 4-1 was 26, after substitutions it was still 26 and the average age of the bench, which included 40-year-old Giggs, was 27.

Every fan base has their idiots, without exception. It is myopic to focus on a handful of disgruntled supporters, fresh from another home humiliation. What happened in the home game that following the comprehensive 3-0 battering by Manchester City? The 70,000 in Old Trafford gave a rapturous supportive ovation to their beleaguered manager and were unanimous in their choral condemnation of that silly plane. It is difficult to imagine the fans of clubs with comparable status such as Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich maintaining comparable sympathy for their manager if they were seventh in their league with scant chance of Champions League football next season. All of the support for Moyes is a proxy support of Ferguson. It is because Ferguson chose him that they maintain the respect for Moyes. It\'s certainly not for his promising previous achievements or exciting, expansive football. United fans standing by Moyes is perhaps the greatest testament to the support of Ferguson, more real than any road or statue. It is blind, unquestioning faith in his final instruction \"your job now is to support your new manager\". According to market research company Kantar, United have a total worldwide fan base of 659 million. How many fans were polled by the Manchester Evening News? If we\'re generous and say 50,000, then the 12,500 fans that blame Ferguson for the current predicament comprise 0.0018 per cent of the fan pool. If this is the metric by which our most respected sports journalists can muse indignantly on the over entitled I-phone generation may I direct them to Twitter? How about radio phone-ins? I\'ve heard several Liverpool fans call for Brendan Rodgers\' head this season after a single poor result. Basing your opinion on the ravings of a silly minority is puzzling. Was the enemy not within when Roy Hodgson got the boot from Anfield? He was appointed in July 2010 and was out by January 2011. Hodgson said of Liverpool’s fans: “The famous Anfield support has not really been there.” Moyes was appointed in July 2013 and is still there despite doing a worse job than Hodgson. Moyes said of United fans: “The crowds have been incredible. I\'m not feeling any pressure from inside the club. It\'s all coming from you people [the media].\" Yet it\'s United fans that have no class according to some. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Henery, Portsmouth</span></font><br/><br/><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">Spot on. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Chrism, Manchester</span></font><br/><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br/><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">No, it isn’t actually, Chris. Take the 0.0018 per cent of the fan pool statistic. It only works if we believe that just under 10 per cent of the world’s population are Manchester United fans. Equally, say we accept 659 million is genuine figure; then on the law of average roughly a quarter of them – close to 165 million – are currently blaming Ferguson. The Hodgson quote is taken from after he was sacked; the Moyes quote while he remains in the job and is desperate for the fans to back him. It is no surprise that they are different in attitude. If Moyes goes in the summer, he might have a more self-pitying take on the pressure he was under. As for the assertion that no United fan would ever blame Ferguson, that simply isn’t true. I go through many comments to produce this debate column – and there is plenty of criticism of Ferguson out there, and not all coming from shallow, aggrieved citizens of Singapore and Chicago who thought the good times would never end. I think the reaction to the plane was less vindication for Moyes, more embarrassment at a stunt that did not reflect well on the supporters, who vocally distanced themselves from it. I do agree, though, that it is only Ferguson’s backing for Moyes and the fans devotion to Ferguson that has prevented the atmosphere becoming more febrile this season.  I think the worst of it may well be over for Moyes and the bulk of the supporters stayed with him, which is admirable, but if he gets this much-vaunted £200m in the summer, it will be interesting to see how long that backing lasts if United are still a conservative team next season. <br/></font></span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Unquestioning loyalty: The vast majority of Manchester United supporters continue to have faith in Moyes\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"402\" id=\"i-aff80ea0\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CBEFED200000578-454_634x402.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Unquestioning loyalty: The vast majority of Manchester United supporters continue to have faith in Moyes</p><div class=\"clear\"> </div><div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Show of support: The Chosen One banner hanging from the upper tier of the Stretford End\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"391\" id=\"i-acb40e84\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/03/article-2595752-1CAAF03A00000578-141_634x391.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Show of support: The Chosen One banner hanging from the upper tier of the Stretford End</p> </div><p> </p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size: 1.2em;\">This is what Roy Hodgson said when he got the job: \'I know Sir Alex is not really a Liverpool man, so I’m a bit concerned about my excellent relationship with him. I sincerely hope he forgives me for moving north and hopefully we can have a glass of wine together, maybe in secret. I hope that’s how he is going to see it.\' He was never a Liverpool manager. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Suckdaroot, Old Oswestry</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No, he was a Liverpool manager who did not understand the rules of engagement in the north-west. Ferguson did, Rafael Benitez did, Brendan Rodgers does, David Moyes doesn’t, strangely. Hodgson didn’t think the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester United mattered, he thought his friendship with Ferguson was more important than any petty enmity. In displaying this attitude he alienated Liverpool’s fans. Benitez got it straight away, and so did Rodgers by pouncing on Moyes when he said Liverpool were favourites to win at Old Trafford. I think Roy is a very decent guy and there were more valid reasons to criticise him at Liverpool than his relationship with a rival. I think it says a lot for him that he didn’t feel it mattered. Football has always been tribal, but now it’s like the Khmer Rouge. No other viewpoint is acceptable.</span></font></p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>United fans are not responsible for camera close-ups of Ferguson’s face each time we concede.

This is not the first time this statement has been made on Sunday Supplement, and it is why the press are easy on Moyes. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Little Helper, Boston</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">That quote wasn’t mine. I’m on Sunday Supplement about as often as Jim Davidson gets invited on Loose Women. I’m a guest this weekend for the first time since January 26 and the occasion before was November 17. I accept though that the line about needing Moyes to succeed to advance the cause of British managers is a familiar one, and I certainly felt that way at the start of the season. Less so now, though. The job Brendan Rodgers has done at Liverpool shows what can be achieved with a progressive British coach, and the failure of imported managers at the bottom of the Premier League table is rather underlining the suspicion that even Jose Mourinho and Rafael Benitez might not have been so eye-catching had they been lumbered with Fulham and Sunderland mid-season. And, in truth, just because Pepe Mel is making hard work of West Brom it doesn’t make all Spanish coaches useless; so whatever happens to Moyes at Old Trafford should not reflect on British managers. A passport never won the title.</span></font></p>\n<div class=\"pageBreak\"> </div>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>The fact that the MEN poll included Ferguson in the list of people to blame for United’s plight means that the media have also identified him as a potential guilty party.

His explanation is that he got tucked up by a South African reporter, who ignored his initial answer to the question, ‘Is United’s failure bad for the Premier League?’ Richard says his answer was, ‘No.’ He then went on to explain that continued failure could cost United overseas fans, but that in his experience those supporters would be picked up by other clubs, such as Chelsea, which is what happened with Liverpool and Manchester United. He said the reporter selected his quotes to make it appear as if he was saying the League needed United to be successful. I have no confirmation either way. All I would say is that, as I put in my little commentary, I have known Richard for a long time and he is far from stupid.

Because as a piece of information, it’s cobblers. United have had three penalties awarded against them in the league this season; compared to six under Ferguson in 2010-11 or five in 2006-07. In his last 11 seasons, Ferguson had 26 penalties awarded against Manchester United in the Premier League. Those are the facts; but here’s Bill with an equally valid theory-based explanation.</span></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The more time you spend defending your own penalty area, the more penalties you concede and the more time you spend attacking the other penalty area the more you win.

I have few heroes and Sir Alex is one of them. This doesn\'t mean he is impervious to criticism. The last few years his tactics became more pragmatic. He didn\'t give young talent enough of a chance. He didn\'t replace the old guard. He didn\'t address the glaring midfield problem. Lastly, he appointed Moyes. A bizarre choice. No level headed United supporter expected a trophy this season or the next, but we expected positive and attractive football.

There was dear old Maureen the tea lady, pushing her trolley through the marble halls and making sure everyone at Highbury was happy. In the warehouse, down the road from the famous old stadium, Arsenal had six or seven old boys making sure the club shop was fully stocked.

Most would agree that it was a pretty tight, family unit. Vice-chairman David Dein kept the club ticking over and secretary Ken Friar was in charge of the club’s administrative matters. They were such a homely club that some days Ian Wright used to turn up at Highbury and start picking up phones on the general switchboard. It certainly surprised a few callers. Times change and Arsenal, just like Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea, have turned into giant, corporate monoliths. Today Arsenal, with a turnover of £250m and a wage bill in the region of £145m per annum, employ around 450 full-time staff. It would be stretching the imagination to think that Wenger is managing a staff of that size, but his tentacles at Arsenal reach far and wide. Everybody knows Wenger rules the roost at Arsenal. Last Friday, ahead of their clash with City at the Emirates, Wenger was asked whether he is accountable to anyone at the club. This was his response: ‘I don’t know’.  Dropping points: Arsenal have not won in three league games after drawing against Man City on Saturday   Unsure: Wenger says he does not know who he is accountable to   Call centre: Ian Wright (second left) often answered the phones at Highbury  Pressed further, he replied: ‘Look, our ambitions for the season - we are in a position where we can still fight for the top, we are in the semi-final of the FA Cup, we went out of the Champions League against Bayern Munich with 10 men and we have been consistent all season so I don’t think you can say our season up to now is a failure.’ In other words, he didn’t really answer the question. At 64, managing a club with the ambitions of a club the size of Arsenal, Wenger could do with some assistance in the day-to-day running of the football department. It makes an awful lot of sense. Take the top leagues in Europe - Spain, Italy, Germany, England and add the newbies Paris St Germain - as an example. Of the 17 clubs who qualified for the Champions League group stages, Arsenal and Manchester United are the only two clubs soldiering on without them. Here they are: Bayern Munich (Mathias Sammer), Borussia Dortmund (Michael Zorc), Bayer Leverkusen (Rudi Voller) and Schalke 04 (Horst Heldt). Juventus (Fabio Paratici), Inter (Marco Branca), Milan (Ariedo Braida) and Napoli (Ricardo Bijon). Barcelona (Andoni Zubizaretta), Real Madrid (Miguel Pardeza), Atletico Madrid (Miguel Angel Gil Marin) and Real Sociedad (Lorenzo Juarros). At Paris St Germain (Olivier Letang and CEO Jean-Claude Blanc share the role).  Old allies: Former Arsenal vice-president David Dein (left) left the club in 2007   Deal-broker: Dein and Wenger unveil Croatian striker Davor Suker in 1999  In England, Chelsea employ Michael Emenalo as director of football and Marina Granovskaia is the conduit between the football board and owner Roman Abramovich. This set-up allows Jose Mourinho to concentrate on the main business of the club, which is planning training sessions and working with his team. At Manchester City, the Barcelona axis of Ferran Soriano (chief executive) and Txiki Begiristain (sporting director) were brought in to take the heat off Roberto Mancini and now Manuel Pellegrini. Even down the road at Tottenham, where there has been an obsession with a continental management structure, chairman Daniel Levy employs Italian Franco Baldini in the role. There have been times in the past when Wenger has considered appointing someone into the role after Dein was fired by Arsenal’s former owner Danny Fiszman in 2007. Reading’s director of football Nicky Hammond was interviewed in the summer of 2007, but in the end it came to nothing.  State of the art: But Arsenal have not won a trophy since moving to the Emirates in 2006  Instead Wenger soldiered on with chief scout Steve Rowley and has found a niche role for Dick Law, previously based in Dallas, to make in roads into transfer business. Arsenal are already preparing for life beyond Wenger and will bring in a director of football to work with a first-team coach when the time comes. That is a decision that has been made by the chief executive Ivan Gazidis as he begins long-term preparations for the day when they need to find a new manager. Last Friday, Wenger reiterated that ‘I have given my word’ when he was asked about the renewal of his contract and Arsenal fans can expect him in the dug-out next season. He is unlikely to walk away now. Instead he will be there and the ambitions of the club - to win the Premier League or Champions League - will remain. To achieve them, it looks like he will need to accept some help.  Forward planning: Chief executive Gazidis (left) is looking to bring in someone above Wenger    More...

Luis Suarez has been magnificent and Brendan Rodgers is a class act. They are the player and manager of the year. Liverpool had success under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, but never played with the same style as Rodgers’ side. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool fans singing: We\'re going to win the league  Unstoppable?

That is an incredible turnaround. Glen Johnson said it would be good for neutrals if Liverpool won the title, but it would be great for English football full stop. They play such fantastic football with a British manager and Sunday had six Englishmen in their starting XI. Suarez and Rodgers should win the individual awards, but they will want to make it a magnificent treble with the title. Liverpool fans singing: We\'re going to win the league  MOURINHO ON THE DEFENSIVE You would expect Arsenal to play two defensive midfielders against Manchester City, but it was a surprise to see Jose Mourinho do it against Crystal Palace. He was without the suspended Ramires, and playing Nemanja Matic made sense because he is cup-tied for Wednesday’s Champions League game, but Tony Pulis will have been pleased to see Oscar and Willian on the bench.  No hope? Jose Mourinho believes his Chelsea side stand no chance of pipping City or Liverpol to the title   Defensive: David Luiz (left) and Nemanja Matic (right) both started at Crystal Palace for Chelsea    Starting Matic and David Luiz played into Palace’s hands. They relished the midfield battle rather than having to deal with Chelsea’s smaller playmakers, and Mile Jedinak was so strong. The result showed it’s not just big head-to-heads that can win you the title. Of the top three, only Liverpool have not lost a game to one of the bottom five.  RECORD RUSS A special mention to Scunthorpe’s Russ Wilcox, who set a Football League record on Saturday. After a 0-0 draw with Wycombe, Wilcox has gone 24 games without defeat, the most by a new boss. With Scunthorpe second in League Two, he could be extending that in League One next season.  Hard to beat: Russ Wilcox has gone 24 games undefeated as Scunthorpe United manager   MARTINEZ WOULD LOVE EURO CASH Everton are doing their part to keep up the Merseyside revival. Roberto Martinez is another exciting manager who has his team playing good, stylish football. With another win, next week’s game against Arsenal is now massive. Finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League would be so important for them.  Cruising: Kevin Mirallas and Everton brushed relegation candidates Fulham aside at Craven Cottage   Licence to thrill: Roberto Martinez is an exciting young manager lighting up the Premier League   Here to stay? Romelu Lukaku (left) and Gareth Barry, on loan from Chelsea and Manchester City respectively, are two members of Martinez\'s impressive Everton squad to have dazzled at Goodison Park this season  A lot of their success this season has been built on loans — Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Gerard Deulofeu. And with Champions League money in the bank, they might just be able to make the signings permanent.  ARSENAL\'S MAIN MIDDLE MAN When Arsenal lost 6-0 to Chelsea, Mathieu Flamini spent the first half on the bench. By the time he came on, his side were 4-0 down.  Pegged back: Mathieu Flamini rallies his Arsenal team-mates after equalising for the Gunners at home   Fighter: Flamini was Arsenal\'s stand-out performer against Manchester City at the Emirates  DISTANCE COVERED DATAMathieu Flamini covered more ground than any other player at the Emirates. Mikel Arteta, at 32 the oldest midfielder on the pitch, was second.Mathieu Flamini: 8.4milesMikel Arteta: 7.5Santi Cazorla: 7.2Fernandinho: 7.1Yaya Toure: 6.9 Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League Against Manchester City, he gave the midfield the legs they needed. He ruffled a few feathers, too, nicking a goal and providing energy. Mikel Arteta is a good playmaker, but looks much better with Flamini alongside him. Against Chelsea, their attacking midfielders closed Arteta then sprang off the back of him and Arsenal couldn’t cope. Flamini helps close things up against powerful midfields, and there is none more powerful than City’s. For years Arsenal have struggled against stronger sides because they are not good enough without the ball. Is Flamini the long-term solution? No, but, with him in the side, Arsenal look a much more solid outfit.  Grafting: Mikel Arteta (right) also covered a lot of ground against City at the Emirates   ODEMWINGIE\'S LAUGHING NOW When he turned up in the QPR car park looking for a transfer, Peter Odemwingie was a bit of a laughing stock, but now he’s proving his quality. He has scored in three games in a row and Stoke have won them all. He works well with Peter Crouch and, with his side playing good football, Mark Hughes could lead Stoke to their first top-10 Premier League finish. They played brilliantly at Aston Villa last weekend and have a great home record — eight wins and just two defeats.  Easily done: Peter Odemwingie (right) celebrates his winner against Hull City on Saturday     HOTSHOT WAYNE Wayne Rooney is now fourth in the all-time Premier League scorers list. He is four goals away from Thierry Henry and 16 off Andy Cole, but can he beat Alan Shearer’s 260? At this rate, Rooney would have to play for seven more seasons to get there. It’s not impossible for somebody of his quality.  Deadeye: Wayne Rooney rifles home from the penalty spot against Aston Villa on Saturday   Enlarge    More...

The former Celtic striker’s client found it all so laughably easy yesterday. Seven minutes from time, Ciftci rolled the ball into the  empty net after a goalkeeping calamity from  Steve Simonsen, standing in for injured Cammy Bell, to seal a William Hill Scottish Cup Final place for Dundee United. Simonsen’s folly was an example of the  individual incompetence at the back as  the Rangers defence was exposed when stepping up in class. Ciftci: I was celebrating before I scored and nearly missed it  Pure joy: Dundee United celebrate Gary Mackay-Steven\'s goal in their 3-1 semi-final win against Rangers Clincher: Dundee United\'s Nadir Ciftci (right) scored their third goal after Steve Simonsen\'s (left) error All smiles: Ciftci celebrates in front of the Dundee United fans after scoring his side\'s third goal vs Rangers  Match FactsRangers: Simonsen, Foster, McCulloch, Mohsni, Steven Smith, Peralta, Black, Aird (Clark 63), Shiels, Law, Daly.

Subs not used: Dillon, Graham, McCallum, El Alagui. Booked: Wilson, Gunning, Armstrong Goals: Armstrong, Mackay-Steven, CiftciReferee: Bobby Madden (Scotland) Attendance: 41,059 There was plenty of ineptitude up front, too, as miserable efforts in front of goal by Dean Shiels and Jon Daly undid a display that was markedly better than last weekend’s flop against Raith Rovers — yet not good enough to stifle one of the country’s more potent attacking teams. Rangers actually looked better for taking the game to one of the Premiership’s top sides this season. After flopping as favourites in the Ramsdens Cup, their supporters loved the  status of being embattled underdogs on their home turf. ‘Defytheodds’ was the advertised hashtag on the tournament sponsors’ big screen advert and it was raucous stuff from the first whistle, the closest this stadium has come to rocking in Old Firm game fashion since Rangers beat Celtic six weeks after being sunk into  administration in 2012. Fraser Aird forced the first corner after a John Souttar slip, then launched pressure upon United keeper Radoslaw Cierzniak, with Lee McCulloch and Bilel Mohsni both having efforts at goal in a packed area. Ibrox roared as loud as on a Glasgow derby day and the action was just as frenetic. There was barely time to draw breath in the first half but, upon settling down, the story to tell at the break was one of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven doling out lessons in being lethal in the aftermath of those Rangers misses.  Lashed home: Stuart Armstrong (centre) gave Dundee United the lead in their Scottish Cup semi-final   Lucky break: Gary Mackay Steven (bottom left) doubled United\'s advantage just before half-time     Ally McCoist had been in the line of fire last week but the manager was let down here by his forwards. Many wondered why Shiels was kept on the bench when that insipid display against Raith at Easter Road was in sore need of a spark last Sunday. Shiels got his movement, run and control all right to latch on to the pass as Daly found  a gap in the United defence. The finish,  however, was all wrong, skewed tamely wide with his left foot from 12 yards. If McCoist has trust issues with the former Kilmarnock man in front of goal, that 19th minute miss explained why. Four minutes later, Armstrong showed Shiels how to keep composed in front of goal. Cifcti gave himself up in his offside position as Armstrong advanced on to Gavin Gunning’s header back into the area. The ball bounced kindly for the Scotland Under-21 midfielder to volley in off Simonsen’s left-hand post. The keeper then palmed away a bouncing effort from Ciftci as the hosts tried and failed to settle in the wake of falling behind. Nicky Law came closest for Rangers when his cross struck an upright, with the unperturbed Cierzniak presumably believing there was no threat. Nor was there any danger from his former colleague Daly who, after Aird’s lay-off, scooped a shot wildly over when left in  penalty-box space for the first and only time on the day. His 18 goals in League One this season counted for little as the Irishman blew it on the big stage.  Getting stuck in: Rangers\' Dean Shiels (left) and Dundee United\'s Paul Paton (right) battle for the ball   Consolation: Steven Smith (centre) pulled one back for Rangers just before the interval at Ibrox Down and out: Shiels looks dejected as Rangers bowed out of the William Hill Scottish Cup on Saturday       United warmed to the theme of Rangers’ failings and struck for a second time against the run of play.Ryan Gauld’s pace and skill took him to the byline and Armstrong helped the cutback on to Mackay-Steven. He took aim with a left-foot shot and Mohsni’s bid to block provided only assistance for United — Simonsen was helpless as that touch sent the ball spinning over the keeper and into the net. With the Rangers forwards flopping in front of goal, it took a set-piece from a defender to drag them into contention. Fair play to left-back Steven Smith for the execution over the wall and accuracy of the effort on target. But the pace should not have caused a top-flight keeper to fail to save at his left-hand post. Cierzniak tried with two hands but the mechanics were all wrong and the ball squirmed in behind him. United were denied an immediate chance to respond when referee Bobby Madden blundered in failing to award a penalty as both Mohsni and Simonsen had an illegal go at stalling Ciftci’s charge. The second half saw Rangers’ pursuit of an equaliser push back a United team seemingly content with a 2-1 scoreline.  Eyes on the prize: Rangers Richard Foster (left) tussles with United\'s Andrew Robertson (right) for the ball   Fervent support: Rangers fans give show their backing for the club before their clash against Dundee United    Smith was in the set-piece mood and, with the aid of a heavy deflection, caused more panic for Cierzniak. As McCulloch and Richard Foster closed in, the keeper clawed the ball off his line. There was always the creeping concern about Rangers that a communication  breakdown would prove costly. With Bell missing and Mohsni as erratic as ever, United were a danger on the break. Ciftci was the length of a stud away from converting substitute Keith Watson’s drilled delivery across the six-yard box. But the Turkish striker was to be presented with another gift that helped him wrap up the win and send United into the Final.  Heavy hit: Ciftci (top) and Rangers captain Lee McCulloch (bottom) collide during their semi-final clash     Foster helped the ball back to Simonsen and the keeper’s terrible touch allowed Ciftci to pinch possession. He could even afford a stumble and another touch before tucking gleefully home in front of a jubilant United contingent, including Stephen Thompson. That was not a bad way to impress his  chairman. In Ciftci’s case, he had managed to please his Celtic-supporting advisor, too.   More...

Twenty-five years ago this week, as history sadly records, 96 of their fans perished in an overcrowded cattle pen, caged in from the  sanctuary of the pitch by a fence of Sheffield steel. That warm day the sun shone a grim light on the deathly scene, but on Saturday the air down there at the Leppings Lane End was cool and soft. The big clock above the South Stand tilted to 3.06pm, the moment in time when the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was abandoned on April 15, 1989. Yet where there had been screams as fathers, sons and daughters heaved in desperation, there was solemnity. Eyes were drawn to the 48 white seats over two rows on each side of the goal that marked the spot where tragedy struck. A rose was placed on every one of them and the name of a victim attached to each stem. VIDEO Scroll to the bottom for former Liverpool greats on the Hillsborough tribute game  Memory: Hillsborough now has 96 white seats decorated with roses and messages for the victims   Red rose: The view of the Hillsborough pitch from the special seats in the Leppings Lane End  Time to remember: The clock at Hillsborough showing 3.06, the time the 1989 semi-final was halted Respect: Sheffield Wednesday tweeted a picture of their programme against Blackburn on Saturday    Horrific: Liverpool fans in the Leppings Lane End crush tried to escape to the upper tier that fateful day  Here, as in every game this weekend in the top eight divisions, the FA Cup and Welsh Premier League, kick-off was delayed seven minutes — a remarkable uniformity of gesture suggesting that this memorial was far more profound than the weekly, though often worthy, ritual of silences or hand-clapping. Outside this old stadium in industrial Sheffield, little clusters of people had gone, on their way in, to pay respect at the permanent memorial by the entrance. Few walked there alone. Husbands and wives entwined arms. Dads told little children what it all meant. Some brought flowers, other scarves or shirts, to adorn the grey stone with its bleak, black-ink inscription: ‘In memory of the 96 men, women and children who tragically died and the countless people whose lives were changed forever.’ The mourners read the words; several stepped back down one of the two deep steps and bowed their heads. It was a scene reminiscent of so many cenotaphs up and down the land on and around Armistice Day. By an hour before kick-off, the throng had grown. People stood three-deep in a little semi-circle  gazing at the plinth, which was surrounded by messages and mementoes from supporters of other clubs, including Manchester United, Everton, Arsenal, Glasgow Rangers and Millwall.   Fateful day: A view of the big screen at Wembley showing the date of the Hillsborough disaster     25 years on: 96 Liverpool scarves are laid at Wembley ahead of the FA Cup semi-finals  A number of the fans, who saw Sheffield Wednesday’s late goal secure a 3-3 draw with Blackburn Rovers, visited the Owls Megastore. Turn back 25 years, and there was a gymnasium on the same site, the one where the stricken were borne on planks of broken advertising hoarding into an impromptu tin morgue. The dead were lined up under red and fawn blankets as neat as dominoes. The commercialisation of football, the need to make money on every square inch you own, saw to it that the gymnasium was razed, leaving behind only its haunted story. Hillsborough still looks like an old-style English ground, with big rectangular stands and corrugated roofs. But the fundamental flaws have been addressed. Championed by the Taylor Report, itself prompted by the tragedy, it is now all-seater, of course. The crowd duly came to sit down here through 102 well-ordered turnstiles. The process to uncover, once and for all, what went wrong 25 years ago is still going on, in a coroner’s court in Warrington, although, out of respect, the new inquest into the 96 deaths will not sit this anniversary week. The fact that the search for justice continues is testimony to the essential fortitude, feistiness and loyalty of Liverpudlians. The families simply refused to submerge under the myth that what occurred here was another easy example of the hooliganism that blighted football in the Seventies and Eighties, the benighted age of the Bradford fire and the shame of Heysel.   Support: Fulham fans pay tribute before the match against Norwich at Craven Cottage   Remembered: The scoreboard at Stoke City\'s Britannia Stadium shows a tribute to the victims   Silence: Kenilworth Road paused before the Skrill Conference match between Luton and Braintree  Representatives of the Hillsborough families were consulted about the ceremonials in Sheffield. On Tuesday, from 10am to 6pm, the ground will be an open house for those who wish to lay flowers inside or out. At 3pm until 3.06pm a short service will be held at the memorial, followed by a minute’s silence. As for the commemoration at Anfield, the important title contest between Liverpool and Manchester City will kick off at 1.37pm. A mosaic with the legend ‘96 25 years’ will be held aloft in the Kop during the silence. A ‘Patch for the 96’ will be laid in the centre circle, and City, along with Celtic, will make floral tributes. After the game, wreaths will be placed on Liverpool’s own memorial. If the all-seater splendour of modern stadiums is one positive legacy of Hillsborough, the knitting together of the football family is another. Thus, Goodison Park will broadcast the annual memorial service at Anfield on a giant screen on Tuesday.  Flowers: Referee Lee Probert and Sunderland winger Adam Johnson carry a wreath at the Stadium of Light   Respect: Everton players watch as Fabio Borini of Sunderland lays the floral wreath on the pitch   Black armband: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet takes his place in the dugout before the match   Head bowed: Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard pays his respects ahead of the clash at Sunderland  The healing is not yet done and it would be glib to suggest that for Liverpool, the Premier League leaders, winning the championship of England for the first time in 24 years would be anything like adequate recompense for Hillsborough, the ground which gave its name to a tragedy. But as Evelyn Mills, who identified the body of her brother Peter McDonnell here 25 years ago, said: ‘it would be a little help along our way’.  Arm in arm: Stoke and Newcastle\'s teams pause for a minute\'s silence at the Britannia   Message: A tribute is displayed on the scoreboard at Selhurst Park, where Crystal Palace played Aston Villa   Observance: Players, fans and officials observe the minute\'s silence at Fulham\'s Craven Cottage ground  Dalglish: We laugh at same stories every time we\'re back together Whelan: I will drive Kenny home to make sure he starts me Evans: It\'s nice to have a Premier League which is competitive Kennedy: It\'s a fantastic opportunity to pay a tribute to the 96   More...

People stood three-deep in a little semi-circle  gazing at the plinth, which was surrounded by messages and mementoes from supporters of other clubs, including Manchester United, Everton, Arsenal, Glasgow Rangers and Millwall.</font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Fateful day: A view of the big screen at Wembley showing the date of the Hillsborough disaster\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"408\" id=\"i-a6b70e56\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603141-1D0D924500000578-824_634x408.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Fateful day: A view of the big screen at Wembley showing the date of the Hillsborough disaster</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"25 years on: 96 Liverpool scarves are laid at Wembley ahead of the FA Cup semi-finals\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"410\" id=\"i-a8470e61\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603141-1D0D8F1300000578-648_634x410.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">25 years on: 96 Liverpool scarves are laid at Wembley ahead of the FA Cup semi-finals</p> </div>\n<font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"></font>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">A number of the fans, who saw Sheffield Wednesday’s late goal secure a 3-3 draw with Blackburn Rovers, visited the Owls Megastore. Turn back 25 years, and there was a gymnasium on the same site, the one where the stricken were borne on planks of broken advertising hoarding into an impromptu tin morgue. The dead were lined up under red and fawn blankets as neat as dominoes.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The commercialisation of football, the need to make money on every square inch you own, saw to it that the gymnasium was razed, leaving behind only its haunted story. Hillsborough still looks like an old-style English ground, with big rectangular stands and corrugated roofs. But the fundamental flaws have been addressed. Championed by the Taylor Report, itself prompted by the tragedy, it is now all-seater, of course. The crowd duly came to sit down here through 102 well-ordered turnstiles.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The process to uncover, once and for all, what went wrong 25 years ago is still going on, in a coroner’s court in Warrington, although, out of respect, the new inquest into the 96 deaths will not sit this anniversary week. The fact that the search for justice continues is testimony to the essential fortitude, feistiness and loyalty of Liverpudlians. <br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">The families simply refused to submerge under the myth that what occurred here was another easy example of the hooliganism that blighted football in the Seventies and Eighties, the benighted age of the Bradford fire and the shame of Heysel.</font></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Support: Fulham fans pay tribute before the match against Norwich at Craven Cottage\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"468\" id=\"i-a76d0e62\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603141-1D0C530D00000578-841_634x468.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Support: Fulham fans pay tribute before the match against Norwich at Craven Cottage<br/></p></div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Remembered: The scoreboard at Stoke City\'s Britannia Stadium shows a tribute to the victims\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"476\" id=\"i-9a750e31\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603141-1D0C30C900000578-82_634x476.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Remembered: The scoreboard at Stoke City\'s Britannia Stadium shows a tribute to the victims</p> </div>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n<div class=\"artSplitter\"> <img alt=\"Silence: Kenilworth Road paused before the Skrill Conference match between Luton and Braintree\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" height=\"420\" id=\"i-a73d0e57\" src=\"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/12/article-2603141-1D0C50A600000578-608_634x420.jpg\" width=\"634\"/> <p class=\"imageCaption\">Silence: Kenilworth Road paused before the Skrill Conference match between Luton and Braintree</p></div>\n<font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\"></font>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">Representatives of the Hillsborough families were consulted about the ceremonials in Sheffield.

After the game, wreaths will be placed on Liverpool’s own memorial.<br/></font></p>\n<p><font style=\"font-size:1.2em;\">If the all-seater splendour of modern stadiums is one positive legacy of Hillsborough, the knitting together of the football family is another.

| Updated: 15:47 EST, 12 April 2014 9 shares 6 View comments  It\'s moving day at the Masters and once again we\'ll make sure you don\'t miss a thing with our live coverage. Bubba Watson started his round with a three-shot lead over John Senden but the 2012 champion has already looked nervous, dropping shots on the front-nine to open things up at the top. Jonas Blixt and Jordan Spieth are right in the mix, while veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez is on three-under-par after a fine early round of 66. Rory McIlroy, the pre-tournament favourite, was left frustrated as a one-under-par round of 70 failed to bring him back into contention for the coveted green jacket. We\'ll bring you the latest action as it happens with all the news from Augusta and the best pictures. You can follow your favourites with our leaderboard on the right and let us know what you think or who you\'re tipping by emailing joe.strange@mailonline.co.uk And if you fancy a bet, you can get all the latest live odds from our betting partner Coral by clicking HERE.   Out in front: Bubba Watson is the man they\'re all chasing at Augusta  Joe Strange Host commentator Auto-update 23:05 Scott\'s struggles Adam Scott misses a birdie chance on the par-three 16th and remains on two-over for the tournament. The Aussie was among the favourites after the cut was made last night but he looks unlikely to retain his green jacket. Meanwhile Bjorn has just made another bogey on 15, leaving him three-under with three to play. 23:00 Bjorn finds the water... again Bjorn\'s second shot at the par-five 15th hits the bank and rolls back into the water. He needs to minimise the damage here with holes fast running out. 22:54 Spieth closes the gap Successive birdies for Spieth, who makes a four at the par-five 15th to move to second on the leaderboard. You\'d never know it was his first Masters. 22:52 Kuchar reacts to his third round 68 \'I drove it well, I was in a lot of fairways. I played some good, steady golf today. \'I\'ve been playing some good golf. It\'s nice to be part of the conversation and in with a chance on Sunday.\' Near the top: Matt Kuchar currently holds the clubhouse lead 22:46 What a waste Watson three-putts from within 20 feet and misses a clear opportunity to extend his advantage at the top. Maybe a few nerves creeping into our leader. Frustrated: Watson reacts after missing a birdie chance 22:43 Super Senden Beautiful pitch shot from Senden, who knocks his third to within a couple of feet of the 13th hole. A birdie there will get him back to two-under. 22:41 Watson finds the green No such problem for Watson who, after a huge drive, gets his approach within 20 feet on the 13th. He\'ll have a put for eagle, which could put him four shots clear. Chance: Watson gave himself an excellent eagle opportunity on the 13th 22:39 Double boost for Watson Bjorn and Blixt both make bogey at the par-five 15th after finding the water. Two more victims of Amen Corner\'s tricky final hole... 22:37 Furyk and Kuchar make bogeys After finding the water, Furyk makes a bogey at the 15th and drops back to three-under. Kuchar finishes his best round of the week with a bogey at the last but the American is still four-under-par and holds the clubhouse lead. 22:31 Blixt and Bjorn find the water Blixt finds the creek with his second shot at the par-five 13th, before his playing partner Bjorn does exactly the same just moments later. Watson could find himself a little further in front of the European duo shortly. Under pressure: Blixt, pictured here reacting to a missed putt at the sixth, has found the water on the 13th 22:28 Westwood reacts to his third round 70 \'I played really solidly. I hit a lot of good shots all day and gave myself a lot of birdie opportunities. \'I\'ll be there or thereabouts by the end of today depending on what Bubba and a few others do.\' 22:22 Missed opportunity for Watson Bubba has a 20-foot uphill putt on the 11th but he doesn\'t hit it and misses a chance to extend his lead with another birdie. Meanwhile Couples is back to two-under after his pinpoint approach on the par-four 14th leads to an easy three. 22:17 Westwood finishes with a par Well-judged first putt from Westwood on the 18th and he holes his second from two feet to finish with a par. That\'s a round of 70 for Westwood, leaving him two-under and right in the mix on Sunday as it stands. 22:10 So close from Blixt Brilliant shot from Blixt out of the drop zone after his approach found the wet stuff. The Swede\'s effort just misses the hole and he\'ll have a tap-in for a bogey. 22:09 Westwood drops a shot Westwood\'s putt on the 17th comes up short and the Englishman goes back to two-under for the tournament. If he can par or birdie the last, Westwood will have a chance tomorrow. Dropping back: Westwood could only manage a bogey on the 17th 22:06 Blixt finds the water Mistake from Blixt, whose long iron shot on the 11 takes a big bounce and cannons into the water. Looks like the man from Sweden could be dropping a shot here. 22:04 Watson back at the top Watson does get his birdie at the 10th, sliding in his putt from a couple of feet after a fine approach. The 2012 champ is now back on his own at the top on six-under-par. Unique: Watson\'s individual style has helped him to the top of the leaderboard 22:02 Kuchar ties things up Consecutive birdies from Kuchar, who joins Watson, Blixt and Bjorn at the top of the leaderboard on five-under-par. Sunday is going to be perfectly set up if this continues. 22:00 More magic from Bubba Fantastic second shot from Watson, who almost finds the hole on the 10th. Looks like that\'ll be a birdie for Bubba, who will move a shot clear at six-under if he doesn\'t mess it up. 21:54 Couples gets a roar Veteran Fred Couples gets a huge cheer from the patrons with a lovely birdie on the 11th. He\'s back to one-under with Rose, who is already in the clubhouse. Still in it: Fred Couples is hoping to make history after winning the Masters in 1992 21:49 All level at the top Birdies for Bjorn and Blixt at the ninth mean the pair are now level with Watson on five-under par. Kuchar and Spieth are a shot further back on four-under. How quickly things can change at Augusta. 21:44 Westwood looking good at -3 Westwood hits another beautiful shot on the 16th par 3. Should slot this away nicely for another birdie. Whisper it quietly but he\'s starting to really put pressure on the leaders... 21:41 Is the pressure getting to Watson? Watson seems to be looking a little nervous out there. Don\'t tell him that Blixt has just made a birdie on the ninth... 21:37 Westwood almost in the water Westwood is so close to having to go for a swim on the 15th.  Luckily for the Englishman the ball sits kindly on the bank. Westwood should be able to get himself closer to an under par finish on this hole 21:32 Well in, Rose! Rose in at -1, and not out of it. When you consider he was +5 thru 11 and wet at 12, that\'s a tremendous effort #TheMasterswithTitleist— Golf Monthly (@GolfMonthly) April 12, 2014 21:30 We\'re behind you Bubba! Watson continues his brilliant Augusta driving with a thunderous strike to get the eight underway. Bubba has been playing some brilliant stuff, but is now leading by just one. Can he stay in the lead under pressure from Blixt and Spieth? 21:26 Westwood makes par putt Westwood makes an excellent 15-foot putt on the 14th, but it goes just past the cup. He taps home for par. 21:25 Bubba Watson\'s no 3-putt streak comes to an end after a 3-putt bogey on No. 6. He had gone 296 holes without one. #Masters— Golf Central (@GolfCentral) April 12, 2014 21:23 Rose has Watson in his sights Justin Rose: \'I was pleased with that round. It was a bit of a roller-coaster but I felt i made a great eagle at 13. \'I felt I could have finished at 3 under, which would have been brilliant but I\'m still I it. \'I saw Bubba struggling, so I think I\'m right in it at this point.\' 21:21 Bubba\'s in the sand Watson over-hits a bunker shot and has to watch agonisingly as the ball roles past the flag and towards the edge of the green...It stayson the dancefloor, just! 21:19 That\'s it for Rose - 69 Rose gets the par! Just sneaks below 70 with a 69 for the day! He\'ll be pleased with that, but it could so easily have been 68. 21:18 Rose misses the birdie Justin Rose misses the chance to finish with a birdie on the 18th and has left himself some work to do to make par on the last... 21:15 Good day for Fowler Rickie Fowler on his 67: \'I knew it was going to be tough, but I\'ve been swinging well and am happy with how I played today.\' 21:14 Bubba makes a Bogie! Disappointment for Watson as he makes a bogie on the sixth. It doesn\'t seem to bother the American, however, as he wanders over to the seventh and hits an excellent drive. 21:06 Bogey for Rose Frustrating finish for Rose, who underhits a putt on 17 and drops a shot to go back to one-under-par. He has a chance to make it back on the 18th, though. 21:02 Poulter reacts to his third round 70 \'I\'m disgusted with a round which looks pretty good. \'We\'ll have to see what Bubba does around the golf course. The pins are in positions where guys can make plenty of birdies. \'I\'m just going to have a run at him on Sunday.\' 20:57 So close for Blixt Blixt almost makes another birdie on six but his putt misses by an inch. Better news for Thomas Bjorn though, who finds the cup with his second shot to get to four-under. This is getting very good. 20:54 Oosthuizen\'s challenge fading Louis Oosthuizen was near the top of the leaderboard after day one but the South African\'s challenge looks like it could be over. He\'s just dunked his ball in the water at 11 and will almost certainly make at least a bogey. Struggling: Louis Oosthuizen has been far from his best so far today 20:51 Spieth at it again Second birdie of the day for Spieth, who moves to four-under with a two at the par-three sixth. The American is now tied for second with Blixt. 20:47 Poulter finishes level Poulter finishes with a two-under-par 69 to leave him level-par for the tournament. He\'s still got a lot of work to do tomorrow but he\'s given himself a chance to win his first ever Major Championship. 20:45 Bubba drops a shot Watson\'s putt on the fourth drifts to the left of the hole and it\'s another bogey for our leader. Fowler misses a chance to finish with another birdie but he\'s still had an exceptional round. He\'s three-under heading into Sunday. Good and bad: Bubba Watson has endured a mixed start to his third round 20:43 Rose does it again Rose holes a long put on the par-five 15th after his ball was fortunate not to roll back into the water. The Englishman is now two-under and right back in the mix.   20:40 McIlroy reacts after his third round 71 \'I enjoyed the round. It\'s not an experience I want to have again. \'The course was fiery from the start. The guys are going to find it pretty interesting this afternoon. \'I felt I played well enough to shoot something a lot lower. I think anything around 70, 69 is going to be a really good score.\' 20:38 Kuchar moves to three-under Third birdie of the day for Kuchar, who reaches the turn at three-under after a bogey-free front-nine. Lots of American interest at the top of the leaderboard now. 20:34 And Senden\'s struggling too Second bogey of the day for Senden, who misses an eight-footer before tapping in. He\'s back to three-under after making up for his first bogey with a birdie at the second. 20:32 Scott struggling Double bogey on the fourth for defending champion Scott, who has now dropped three shots in his opening four holes. The Aussie has gone back to level-par in no time at all. 20:30 Who are you backing? If, like me, your Masters bets are already dead and buried, click HERE for the latest live odds from Coral. My money is on Bubba to see it through, which probably means he\'ll bogey every hole on Sunday... 20:25 Eagle for Rose Wonderful eagle from Rose on the final hole of Amen Corner which takes him to one-under. The US Open champ is three-under for the day and just behind a big pack on two-under for the tournament after following it up with a par at the 14th. 20:20 Fowler finishing well Super run for Rickie Fowler, who birdies 15 and 16 to get to three-under with two to play. The 25-year-old is five-under for the day. 20:15 Bubba strikes back Senden makes up for his bogey on the first with a an eight-footer for birdie but he\'s outdone by Watson, who holes his putt after reaching the green in two for an eagle. The 2012 champion is back to eight-under and leads by four. 20:10 Spieth up to second Jordan Spieth calmly holes his putt on the fourth for a birdie, sending him into second behind Watson. It\'s been a fine Masters debut from the youngster so far. Big future: Jordan Spieth tees off on the first hole 20:06 Bogeys for Watson, Scott and Senden Nervy starts from Watson, Senden and defending champion Scott, each of whom bogey the first. Watson now sits on six-under, while Senden is level with Jimenez, Blixt, Bjorn, Furyk and Spieth on three-under. It\'s getting tight at the top. 20:03 Disappointing finish for Woodland Woodland finishes his round at level-par after a three-under 69 but it could\'ve been so much better. The American was seven-under for the day after 10 holes but stuttered through Amen Corner before bogeying the last. Frustrated figure: Woodland reacts after a poor shot on the 11th 19:56 Americans on the up American trio Kevin Stadler, Matt Kuchar and Jim Furyk have all started well today. Stadler has picked up a shot and is two-under alongside Kuchar, while Furyk is now tied third with Jimenez on three-under. Leader Bubba Watson has also began his third round. In the mix: Furyk makes his approach to the first green 19:50 Magic from Jimenez What a wonderful performance from Jimenez, who finishes three-under-par after his best round of the week. The 50-year-old rolled back the years for a six-under-par round - the best of the week - which included seven birdies. The Spaniard is currently third behind Bubba Watson and John Senden. Sandy Lyle finishes the day four-over-par and eight-over for the tournament. 19:46 McIlroy praises Masters marker Knox After shooting a worse score than his non-competitive playing partner Jeff Knox, Rory McIlroy had some kind words for the amateur golfer. McIlroy said: \'Jeff is a great player and beat me by one. I thought he was going to be nice and three-putt the last so we could have a nice half! \'I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen anyone putt the greens so well. I was thinking of getting him to read some of mine. He looked like he should be playing in the Masters.\' 19:42 Clarke and Olazabal finish up Similar rounds for playing partners Olazabal and Clarke, who both began the day on four-over and ended it a shot worse off. Legend: Jose Maria Olazabal managed a one-over-par 73 on day three at Augusta 19:37 Brit watch Poulter and Westwood are level on one-under-par after the former could only make bogey at Amen Corner\'s tricky par-three. Steven Gallacher is also one-under after pars on the first and second, while Jamie Donaldson has dropped to one-over after two bogeys in his first four holes. 19:27 Luiten and Day finish up Contrasting fortunes for playing partners Day and Luiten on the 18th, with the former making bogey to finish on two-over-par and the latter grabbing a rare birdie to end on nine-over for the tournament. Tough times: Joost Luiten could only manage a five-over-par 77 on Saturday 19:20 Jimenez on the charge What a performance by Jimenez. The Spaniard has just made his seventh birdie of the day at the par-three 16th to go three-under-par for the tournament. If he can avoid any mistakes on the last two holes then he should be in the mix at the top of the leaderboard tomorrow. On fire: Jimenez plays his approach shot on the par-four seventh 19:10 Day not giving up Jason Day has been quietly going about his business today and the Aussie is back to one-over-par after birdies at 13 and 15. Another on the 18th would be a lovely way for him to finish his round ahead of Sunday. 19:01 More shots being clawed back Jimenez makes consecutive birdies at 13 and 14 to get to two-under with four holes still to play. He\'s joined on the same score by Woodland, who has recovered from a double bogey on the 12th to birdie the 13th. Poulter is a few holes behind but successive birdies at nine and 10 have the Englishman also on two-under. 18:56 Westwood gets into the red Excellent start for Lee Westwood, who pars the first and then birdies the par-five second to go one-under. Another steady par on the third and lad from Worksop looks in a good position to post a decent score today. Looking good: Lee Westwood jumps out of a bunker on the first to follow the flight of his ball 18:49 McIlroy outplayed by marker Knox Turns out McIlroy\'s 71 was actually a shot more than Masters marker Jeff Knox managed this afternoon. The 51-year-old, who played alongside McIlroy because of the odd number of players who made the cut, shot a two-under-par 70. Well played, Jeff. Playing partners: McIlroy (right) shares a joke with Knox (left) 18:39 Woodland slipping back After his first bogey of the day at the 11th, Woodland drops two more shots at the 12th after dumping his ball in Rae\'s Creek. He\'s now back to one-under for the tournament and currently tied for 10th. Amen Corner hasn\'t been kind to the American today. 18:35 Beware of the bogeys Woodland records his first bogey of the day at the par-four 11th and drops back to three-under. Poulter and Jimenez were the other two making moves but both have been halted with bogeys at the seventh and 12th respectively. The pair are now both on level-par. 18:26 McIlroy finishes well Strong finish from McIlroy, who birdies the 15th, 17th and 18th to finish with a one-under-par 71. The pre-tournament favourite is still three-over and he\'ll need something spectacular to be in with a chance of winning his first green jacket on Sunday night. Frustrating afternoon: McIlroy couldn\'t find his best form on Saturday at Augusta 18:21 Jiminez still smoking No doubt Jimenez will treat himself to a fat cigar if he\'s able to keep up his momentum. The Spaniard has just bagged his fourth birdie of the day at the par-four 11th to move back to one-under. It\'s in the detail: Jimenez (right) checks out his yardage book with his caddy 18:15 Woodland on fire Yet another birdie for Woodland, who moves to seven-under for the day and four-under for the tournament with a three at the par-fourth 10th. This is turning into a ridiculous round of golf from a man whose best finish at Augusta was tied 24th in 2011. 18:09 McIlroy, Poulter and Jimenez on the birdie trail McIlroy pulls a shot back at the par-five 15th but it\'s not been the round the Northern Irishman was hoping for today. Poulter is now one-under-par for the tournament after his third birdie of the day at the fifth, while Jimenez is now level-par after a three at the par-four 10th. Some good scoring out there so far today. On target: Ian Poulter hits his tee shot on the par-three fourth 18:02 Woodland ties front-nine record Another birdie for Woodland at the ninth means the American is out in 30 and now three-under for the tournament. Only four others have managed it: Miller (1975), Norman (1988), Choi (2004) and Mickelson (2009). The 29-year-old is six-under-par for the day. Wow. Charge: Woodland is six-under-par through the front-nine 17:58 Mixed start for Rose After finishing his second round with two birdies it\'s been an interesting start to day three for Justin Rose. The US Open champion got a par on the first, bogeyed the second and then eagled the third to leave him where he started one-over-par. Highs and lows: Justin Rose recorded an eagle on the third after bogeying the second 17:50 Quick start from Mahan Excellent start by Hunter Mahan, who has birdied his opening two holes to get back to level-par. The American tied fourth at last year\'s US Open and he\'ll be in the mix again if he keeps this up. 17:45 Woodland makes another Third birdie of the day for Woodland on the par-five eighth as he gets to five-under for the day and two-under for the tournament. He was two-over for the same eight holes yesterday. It\'s a funny old game. Flying: Gary Woodland is five-under-par through eight holes on day three 17:38 YE Yang drowns his sorrows Aftermath of a rough masters. Miss cut. Drank a lot to wash away the masters blues.— YE Yang (@Y_E_Yang) April 12, 2014 17:34 Poulter and Fowler start strongly Colourful duo Ian Poulter and Rickie Fowler have both begun in superb fashion, grabbing birdies on the second and third to get back to level-par for the tournament. Still a long way to go but they\'re both giving themselves a chance tomorrow as it stands.   17:26 McIlroy heading around Amen Corner It just isn\'t happening for Rory today. He\'s two-over-par for his round and six-over for the tournament. He\'s just negotiated the first two holes of Amen Corner with a pair of pars and is now trying to make up a shot on the par-five 13th. #PrayForRory Struggling: McIlroy is two-over-par for his round after 12 holes 17:18 Haas finding his first round form After a nightmare 78 on Friday, first round leader Haas has recaptured his Thursday form with consecutive birdies on the second and third holes. The American is now back to level-par for the tournament. On the up: First round leader Bill Haas is back to level par 17:16 Money to be made If, like me, your Masters bets are already dead and buried, click HERE for the latest live odds from Coral. You can still get 7/4 on leader Bubba Watson to win back his green jacket. 17:12 Woodland on the charge Another birdie for Woodland on the par-three sixth sees him back in the red at one-under-par for the tournament and four-under for the day. Still a long way to go but encouraging signs from the 29-year-old. 17:02 McIlroy falling further back A third bogey of the day for McIlroy on the par-four 10th sees the pre-tournament favourite at six-over-par with eight holes to play today. Padraig Harrington\'s prediction that Rory would shoot 65 seems a little off... Hard times: McIlroy is now six-over-par after three bogeys in his first 10 holes 16:54 Haas and Olesen underway First round leader Bill Haas has just finished playing the first alongside talented 24-year-old Thorbjorn Olesen. Both started with pars, keeping them at two-over-par with 35 holes to play. 16:50 Jimenez rolling back the years Impressive stuff again from Jimenez at the par-four fifth as he bags his second birdie of the day to drop back to one-over-par. The Spaniard is one of six record-breaking over 50s to have made the cut, with Fred Couples, Larry Mize, Sandy Lyle, Bernhard Langer and Vijay Singh all still in the mix. Still got it: Miguel Angel Jimenez admires his drive on the fourth hole 16:47 Get in touch Don\'t forget you can e-mail me your thoughts on joe.strange@mailonline.co.uk, or tweet me @joe_strange No doubt there will be plenty to discuss over the next seven or eight hours! 16:42 Clarke and Kirk claw back shots Birdies for Clarke on the fifth and Kirk on the second make their respective scorecards look a little better but the same can\'t be said for Olivier Goss. The only amateur left has just posted a double-bogey six on the opening hole, leaving him five-over-par for the tournament. 16:27 Bogeys everywhere Difficult moments for McIlroy, Olazabal and Luiten, who each drop a shot and fall further behind. Better news for 50-year-old Jiminez though, who grabs a birdie at the par-four third to get back to two-over-par. 16:18 Strong start for Woodland Gary Woodland endured a terrible finish to his second round, bogeying the last four holes to finish with a 77. But he hasn\'t let that affect him today, with a birdie on the par-four first bringing him back to two-over-par for the tournament. He then followed it up with the first eagle of the day at the par-five second to get back to level-par. Superb stuff from the American. 16:14 McIlroy whizzing around McIlroy is averaging less than 10 minutes per hole at the moment, with a consecutive pars at the fifth and sixth keeping him at four-over-par. Olazabal gets back to three-over-par with a birdie at the par-five second, while Luiten has dropped another shot with a bogey at the third. On his own: Rory McIlroy watches his approach to the green on the first hole 16:02 No change for McIlroy Pars on the fourth and fifth holes for McIlory, who stays at four-over. Miguel Angel Jimenez and Sandy Lyle both start with a par at the first. The Spaniard stays at three-over, while the Scot is a shot further back. Solid: Sandy Lyle began his third round with a par on the first hole 15:56 Clarke and Olazabal begin Veterans Darren Clarke and Jose Maria Olazabal are playing together this afternoon and the pair have started in identical fashion, both coming away from the first with par. Jason day picks up a birdie on the second to get back to four-over-par, while Luiten gets a par. Experienced: Darren Clarke his his approach shot on the par-four first 15:53 McIlory gives one back After a birdie at the second, McIlroy bogeys the third to fall back to four-over-par for the tournament. A par, a birdie and a bogey in his first three holes. A mixed start, you could say. 15:49 Dfficult start for Day and Luiten Poor opening hole for playing partners Day and Luiten, who both bogey the first. The pair are now five-over-par, 12 shots behind leader Watson. Focused: Jason Day plays his approach shot to the second green 15:43 Super second for McIlroy McIlroy needed a strong start to get over his Friday nightmare and he\'s had just that, posting a birdie at the par-five second to get back to three-over-par. The former US Open champion bogeyed the same hole yesterday. 15:41 Scott under no illusions Last year\'s Masters champions Adam Scott is in contention to retain the green jacket but the Aussie knows that day three can make or break his challenge. He told pgatour.com: \'Today\'s round is extremely important for me. It\'s going to have to be maybe the best round of the week.\' 15:31 Solid start for Rory McIlroy starts his round with a par four on the first hole, keeping him at four-over-par for the tournament. The Northern Irishman\'s WAG, tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, is following her man around Augusta. Again. Jason Day and Joost Luiten have also begun their third rounds. Centre of attention: Rory McIlroy tees off on the first hole 15:26 Best job in the world? McIlroy is playing with Jeff Knox today, who is the official marker of the Masters. The 51-year-old has already played in more tournaments than Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker and Jonas Blixt. Big day: Marker Jeff Knox watches his drive on the first hole 15:19 And we\'re off! Rory McIlroy gets the third round underway on his own. Padraig Harrington reckons Rory can finish with two rounds of 65. He\'ll need something special today if he\'s to get back into contention. 15:05 Weather watch It\'s another gorgeous day in Georgia, with warm temperatures set to dry out the course even further. One positive for the players is the lack of wind, which should allow them greater control off the tee and approaching the greens. Sunny: More warm weather is expected at Augusta for today\'s third round 14:56 Scott looking to make history Defending Masters champion Adam Scott is sat menacingly behind leader Bubba Watson on three-under-par. The Aussie is looking to become only the fourth player in history to retain the coveted green jacket, which would add him to this prestigious list: Jack Nicklaus (\'65, \'66) Nick Faldo (\'89, \'90) Tiger Woods (\'01, \'02) Still going strong: Adam Scott, who sits tied second, is looking to retain his Masters title 14:45 Did you know? The biggest comeback at the Masters after the opening two rounds was eight shots by Jack Burk in 1956. Steve Stricker, KJ Choi, Mike Weir, Henrik Stenson and Stewart Cink are all currently eight shots behind leader Bubba Watson. Can any of them match Burk\'s achievement? Big ask: Henrik Stenson will need to equal the biggest-ever Masters comeback to win his first green jacket 14:37 Get in touch Don\'t forget, you can send in your thoughts on all things Masters and tell us who you\'re tipping. Also, don\'t forget, there\'s money to be made and if you want to place a bet or check out the latest live odds, click HERE for the latest from Coral. 14:32 On his own Rory McIlroy will get Saturday\'s action underway at 3.15pm after scraping into the third round on four-over-par. The 24-year-old had a round to forget after carding a promising 71 on day one, managing a par on the last to make the cut after an error-filled 18 holes. The Northern Irishman will compete on his own, although Jeff Knox looks likely to play as his marker. A total of 51 players made the cut. In trouble: Rory McIlroy takes a shout out of the azaleas on the 13th 14:24 Third round tee times in full 1515 Rory McIlroy (NIrl)1525 Jason Day (Aus), Joost Luiten (Ned)1535 Jose Maria Olazabal (Spa), Darren Clarke (NIrl)1545 Miguel Angel Jimenez (Spa), Sandy Lyle (Sco)1555 Billy Horschel (USA), Gary Woodland (USA)1605 Chris Kirk (USA), Martin Kaymer (Ger)1615 Oliver Goss (Aus - amateur), Francesco Molinari (Ita)1625 Nick Watney (USA), Thongchai Jaidee (Tha)1635 Bill Haas (USA), Thorbjorn Olesen (Den)1655 Ian Poulter (Eng), Rickie Fowler (USA)1705 Steven Bowditch (Aus), Brendon de Jonge (Zim)1715 Hunter Mahan (USA), Justin Rose (Eng)1725 Vijay Singh (Fij), Bernhard Langer (Ger)1735 Steve Stricker (USA), Larry Mize (USA)1745 Mike Weir (Can), KJ Choi (Kor)1755 Henrik Stenson (Swe), Stewart Cink (USA)1805 Lee Westwood (Eng), Brandt Snedeker (USA)1815 Louis Oosthuizen (Rsa), Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano (Spa)1835 Lucas Glover (USA), Matt Kuchar (USA)1845 Kevin Stadler (USA), Jamie Donaldson (Wal)1855 Stephen Gallacher (Sco), Russell Henley (USA)1905 Jim Furyk (USA), Kevin Streelman (USA)1915 Fred Couples (USA), Jimmy Walker (USA)1925 Adam Scott (Aus), Jordan Spieth (USA)1935 Thomas Bjorn (Den), Jonas Blixt (Swe)1945 Bubba Watson (USA), John Senden (Aus) 14:17 Testing times Here\'s a look at Saturday\'s pin positions. Some extremely tricky locations out there today... 14:11 Bubba in control Bubba Watson leads the way heading into the third round, having carded an impressive four-under-par 68 on day two. He tees off last with Aussie John Senden, who sits three shots behind him after shooting a 68 of his own on Friday. Others in the chasing pack include Jordan Spieth, Thomas Bjorn and Jonas Blixt, all of whom are four shots off the lead. Out in front: Bubba Watson sits top of the Masters leaderboard on seven-under-par 14:00 Good afternoon... ...and welcome to Sportsmail\'s live coverage of the Masters. We\'ll be bringing you plenty of build up to the third day of action over the next hour or so, which gets underway with pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy teeing off on his own at 3.15pm BST.

Villa manager Paul Lambert admitted his side were at risk of being sucked into a relegation battle after four consecutive defeats that have left them four points off the drop zone. ‘We have to be optimistic, we can’t let our heads go down, but we do need to stop the losing sequence,’ said Lambert. His side still have to face Manchester City and the pressure is mounting on him. There were some discontented chants coming from the section of travelling fans at Selhurst Park, but Lambert denied that this season’s tally of 34 points after 33 games — identical to last year — indicated a lack of progress. ‘I still think this season we’re a million miles away from last season,’ he said.

We’re still a million miles from where I want Aston Villa to be but there are other things going on.’ Palace manager Tony Pulis denied his side were assured Premier League football next season. But they are certainly heading that way. It was the first time this season that they have won three successive games, scoring five goals and not conceding in the process. Puncheon has scored three of those, but Pulis was keen to spread the plaudits. ‘Puncheon has done fantastic, but I think he will be the first one to say that although he is scoring the goals — and he’ll get the headlines again — the way the whole group work to help one another is pretty inspiring,’ he said. ‘That teamwork, that ethic is what has got us where we are. We’ve got players who have really stood strong when we’ve needed them to.’ Puncheon made the breakthrough on 76 minutes. Yannick Bolasie supplied the cross and the 27-year-old calmly turned in the box and finished low and powerfully past Brad Guzan and in off the post. Palace’s Argentinian goalkeeper Julian Speroni, who could yet get a World Cup call-up, ensured the home side preserved their lead in the 87th minute when he dived low to his left to save a fizzing Andreas Weimann effort.

Who would have thought the only leak would be in Southampton’s defence? At the end of a week of spy mysteries and recriminations, Cardiff City somehow found a glimmer of hope in a season of chaos and a game they looked like losing. They are still on the brink. Indeed, they are still in the bottom three. But Juan Cala’s delightful goal has put Cardiff City back in contention. If they pull it off it will be quite remarkable. But that is a fairly hefty ‘if’, not least because this was a win against a side with little to play for and a side which all but gave up trying after an impressive first half. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has spoken of needing a ‘miracle’. On Saturday, with a member of his staff in the process of being dismissed for leaking team information to Crystal Palace, he was more upbeat. Solskjaer: Atmosphere in the dressing room was great afterwards  Stayed hit! Central defender Juan Cala opened the scoring for Cardiff during their trip to Southampton  MATCH FACTSSouthampton: Gazzaniga 6; Chambers 6.5 (Clyne 67, 6), Fonte 6, Lovren 6, Shaw 6.5; S Davis 6, Schneiderlin 7, Cork 6 (Do Prado 78); Ramírez 6.5 (Gallagher 66, 6), Lambert 6.5, Lallana 6.5.Subs not used: Cropper, Wanyama, Ward-Prowse, Hooiveld.Cardiff City: Marshall 7.5; Theophile 5.5, Caulker 6, Cala 7, Fabio 5.5 (McNaughton 78); Kim 6, Mutch 6, Medel 5.5 (Zaha 61, 6), Whittingham 6, Daehli 6.5 (Bellamy 87); Campbell 6.Subs not used: Lewis, Turner, Eikrem, Gunnarsson.Goal: Cala 61Referee: Jon Moss 6.5Att: 30,526Player ratings by RIATH AL-SAMARRAI at St Mary\'s.

We have ended the week on a high. ‘Before this game I don’t think many expected us to come here and take points. Now we are three points off safety with four games to go. We still need help from others.’ They certainly had a little help from Southampton. Barring efforts from Fraizer Campbell and Peter Whittingham, Cardiff offered little in the first half. At the other end, Southampton were a blitz of movement and attacking touches. Gaston Ramirez hit the bar after 21 minutes and shortly afterwards Rickie Lambert’s free-kick forced David Marshall to save low to his right. Marshall has been superb this season, certainly the only Cardiff player who has. He stopped Lambert again shortly before the break and with it Cardiff had a platform to deliver a significant surprise. Cala made the defining contribution after 65 minutes. Whittingham’s free-kick from the left had pinballed between a couple of Southampton heads before Calum Chambers nodded it to the edge of the area. Cala controlled on his chest, sidestepped Steven Davis and curled his shot past Paulo Gazzaniga. Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino said: ‘It was probably the easiest game we have had for possession, but you need to take chances. ‘If you analyse it you see Cardiff defending with nine men behind the ball and that is hard to break down.’  Delight! Cala runs off to celebrate alongside substitute Wilfried Zaha after scoring a blinding drive   Salute!

The Welsh side looked set to suffer a similarly large defeat at St Mary\'s after a woeful first half in which Gaston Ramirez rattled the crossbar.However, wayward finishing and a fine display from goalkeeper David Marshall kept the hosts at bay, allowing the away side to sneak an improbable win from a surprising source.Having failed to clear their line, Cala - one of four changes from last weekend\'s embarrassing loss - showed poise and skill few would expect from a centre-back to strike home from the edge of the box.Pochettino\'s side pressed for a late leveller but it was not to be as they failed to score for just the sixth time this season, giving Solskjaer\'s men a huge three points.Saints made one change for the match as Ramirez came in for the injured Jay Rodriguez, who the hosts\' players showed support for in the warm-up by wearing training shirts with the number nine on the back.The in-form forward\'s absence did little to stop Southampton\'s attacking flow, though, and Cala had to be alert early to prevent an early Luke Shaw cross being tucked away.The Spanish centre-back did well to deny Adam Lallana soon after and Fabio deflected a Steven Davis cross behind as Cardiff were pinned back.Whittingham attempted to catch out Saints goalkeeper Gazzaniga from a free-kick in a rare moment of respite for the visitors.

[ Lambert headed over at the far post as Saints upped the ante, with Ramirez hitting a fizzing effort which rattled the crossbar after taking a slight deflection off Steven Caulker. Marshall did well to claw away a 22-yard free-kick from Lambert as the hosts continued in the ascendancy, with pair going head-to-head again when the England forward wriggled free to prod goalwards. Referee Jon Moss waved away appeals for handball against Caulker as half-time approached, before which Whittingham attempted to catch Gazzaniga out direct from a corner. The Argentinian goalkeeper, playing due to injuries to Artur Boruc and Kelvin Davis was clearly being targeted at set plays but City were struggling unsettle him. Solskjaer brought on Wilfried Zaha early in the second half in a bid to add a new attacking dimension to a Cardiff side, who only had a Jordon Mutch effort from distance to show for their endeavours in the 15 minutes after the restart. Morgan Schneiderlin and Ramirez had shots blocked in that time as Saints continued to dominate, with Lambert nodding over a fine Chambers cross. Focus: Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino Down?

Chance! Paulo Gazzaniga gets two hands to a punch as Campbell looked to put Cardiff ahead   Respect: Players and supporters remembered the 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster before the game   Get rid of it! Jose Fonte hurries a clearance with Campbell lurking in the Southampton penalty area   Means a lot: Solskjaer was all smiles after saluting the away fans and congratulated his side Ramirez comically collapsed in a heap when trying to control a Jack Cork ball over the top - a let-off for Cardiff given the Uruguayan playmaker was clean through.It was the latest in a long line of missed opportunities that the home side were made to rue in the 65th minute.Having failed to clear their lines, Cala took the loose ball on his chest, jinked free and unleashed a wondrous left-footed drive past Gazzaniga to the delight of 2,404 travelling fans.Nathaniel Clyne and Sam Gallagher came on as Saints looked for a response, with the latter quickly in the action. A real pest: The lively Campbell was a thorn in the home side\'s defence all afternoon   Take it in and play on: Rickie Lambert pops a ball off while being closely tracked by Medel   Putting a shift in: Gaston Ramirez closes down Peter Whittingham as Saints looked to press   Having just failed to meet a Lambert header, the teenager soon collected a chipped ball from Schneiderlin - only to be denied by Marshall.The Scotland international came under increasing pressure as the clock wound down and denied Clyne by wonderfully tipping wide.Guly do Prado failed with a tame header and Lambert miscontrolled the backpost as the clock wound down, leaving gaps at the back.Zaha showed great skill and strength before being denied by Gazzaniga late on, but it mattered little for Cardiff as they held out for victory.
